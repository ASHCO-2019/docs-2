Its website provides files for downloading and also instructions for the most popular package managers. For example, if using Homebrew in macOS:\nbrew install mercurial\n\nOr in Debian/Ubuntu Linux with apt-get:\napt-get install mercurial\n\nGetting the code\nThis will take a long time, because the repository is B¬†¬†I¬†¬†G (Firefox is more than 10 years old and there are lots of commits every day!). So please be patient.\nYou will also need a lot of disk space (about ~40Gb free).\ncd ~ # or the folder where you store your projects, for example ~/projects\nhg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central\n\nBuilding and running locally\nAlthough DevTools is written in JavaScript, the core of Firefox is not‚Äîwe need tools such as compilers to build the C/C++/Rust code and turn it into binaries that our computer can run.\nIf you're a web developer, you might not be familiar with these tools, but fortunately, the Firefox team has made a very good job of automating the process of installing them with bootstrap scripts, and putting documentation together. You don't need to read it now; as we'll provide a simplified way to build the code, but if you have any issues, please refer to the documentation.\nTry building Firefox and downloading dependencies by running the following commands:\n./mach bootstrap\n\nThis script might ask you questions, so it's recommended to keep an eye on the terminal while it's running‚Äîotherwise it will never finish!\nPlease note, when you are prompted for your name and add unicode characters this can crash the process. The workaround here is to use ascii-friendly characters and later on edit your ~/.hgrc file manually to use the unicode characters in your name.\nAfter it finishes, you might be asked to add some lines to a mozconfig file. Create this file in the repository folder (i.e. in ~/mozilla-central), then add the lines.\nThen run this:\n./mach configure\n./mach build\n\nPlease note, if this fails it might be possible you need to run the bootstrap.py script first. Download the bootstrap.py script and save it in your project directory. Then run python bootstrap.py and follow the prompted steps.\nNote: if using Windows, you might need to type the commands without the ./:\nmach bootstrap\nmach configure\nmach build\n\nIf your system needs additional dependencies installed (for example, Python, or a compiler, etc) the above commands might fail, and various diagnostic messages will be printed to your screen. Follow their advice and then try running the command that failed again, until the three of them complete successfully.\nSome error messages can be quite cryptic. It is a good idea to consult the documentation specific to the platform you're using. Sometimes searching in the internet for the specific error message you get can help, and you can also get in touch if you get stuck.\nOnce you complete a first successful build, you should be able to build again by running only this command:\n./mach build\n\nBy the way, building takes a long time (specially on slow computers).\nRunning your own compiled version of Firefox\nTo run the Firefox you just compiled:\n./mach run\n\nThis will run using an empty temporary profile which is discarded when you close the browser. We will look into persistent development profiles later. But first...\n‚≠êÔ∏è  Time for some congratulations! You managed to get Firefox's code, build tools and dependencies, and just run your very own copy of Firefox! Well done! ‚≠ê   Ô∏è \nRebuilding\n\nSuppose you pulled the latest changes from the remote repository (or made some changes, to experiment and see what happens) and want to build again.\nYou can ask the mach script to build only changed files:\n./mach build faster\n\nThis should be faster (a matter of seconds).\nSometimes, if you haven't updated in a while, you'll be told that you need to clobber, or basically delete precompiled stuff and start from scratch, because there are too many changes. The way to do it is:\n./mach clobber\n\nIt is a bit tedious to do this manually, but fortunately you can add an entry to mozconfig to have this done automatically for you each time it's required. Add this and save the file:\n# Automatically clobber when an incremental build is not possible\nmk_add_options AUTOCLOBBER=1\nBuilding even faster with artifact builds\nIt is unusual to modify C/C++ code when working on DevTools. This means that we can use artifact builds. This method downloads prebuilt binary components, and then the build process becomes faster.\nAdd the following content to mozconfig:\n# Automatically download and use compiled C++ components:\nac_add_options --enable-artifact-builds\n\n# Write build artifacts to:\nmk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend\n\nAnd then you can follow the normal build process again (only faster!)\nNote: On macOS you might want to use MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend.noindex instead. Using the .noindex file extension prevents the Spotlight from indexing your objdir, which is slow.\nFor more information on aspects such as technical limitations of artifact builds, read the Artifact Builds page.\nUpdating worker code requires a few extra steps\nPrerequisite\n\nInstall yarn 1.x globally via npm install -g yarn if you do not have it installed globally already.\nGo to the client/debugger/ directory and run npm install.\n\nRegenerating work bundle\n\nSave the modified files.\nBack in your terminal, under client/debugger/ directory, execute node bin/build.\nAfter completion, use the Restart (Developer) option that is available under the File menu in local builds (or its respective shortcut).\n\n"},"getting-started/development-profiles.html":{"url":"getting-started/development-profiles.html","title":"Create a development profile","keywords":"","body":"Setting up a development profile\nYou can have various Firefox profiles (think of something like \"user accounts\"), each one with different settings, addons, appearance, etc.\nThis page will guide you through configuring a new profile to enable development features such as additional logging, dumping of network packets, remote debugging, etc. which will help when working in DevTools.\nMany of these changes are achieved by modifying preferences in about:config, a special page you can access by typing in about:config in Firefox's URL bar. The first time, it will show you a warning page. Click through or disable the warning for the future, and then you can start searching for preferences to modify.\n(If you're curious, here's more information about about:config)\nCreate a permanent profile\nWe were using a temporary profile in the previous step, building DevTools.

They help us a lot and are very valuable (specially when they come with reproducible steps, e.g. in the case of crashes or malfunctions). Here is a short guide on how to file good bugs if you've never done it before (or if you need a reminder).\nAnother thing that is super valuable is reproducing bugs (to validate they're happening in more than one environment), and also completing bugs, i.e. ensuring the bug has steps to reproduce, a test case, etc, as mentioned on the guide. This saves time for the person(s) who will work on the bug, as then they can jump straight to fixing or implementing whatever is needed, instead of doing research work. If you can do any of these for a given bug, add a comment with the additional data that you found out.\nLikewise, if you think that a bug is solved, because you can't reproduce it and doesn't happen any more, this is also useful to know.

It is absolutely fine to also talk to someone via other means (e.g. irc, email, in the office kitchen...), but it is good to come back to the bug and add the extra information, just in case you stop working on the bug at some point and someone else has to pick work where you left it.\nFind out where are the files that need changing\nIn an ideal world, the bug has this information from the start, but very often it doesn't.\nIf you're not yet familiar with the codebase, the files and directories overview might help you find where things are.\nIf you know what you're looking for (e.g. a string that has a typo and needs correcting, or a function name that needs modifying), you can use a source code search engine:\n\nSearchfox\n\nIt is a good idea to add smart keyword searches for DXR to search faster.\nYou can also use your operating system's command line. For example, let's search for occurrences of TODO in the code base.\nWithin your command line prompt, cd to the devtools directory:\ncd ~/mozilla-central/devtools # use your actual folder name!\ngrep -r 'TODO' .\n\nThis will list all the places in the DevTools code that contain the TODO string. If there are too many instances, you can combine the above with less, to scroll and paginate the output of grep:\ngrep -r 'TODO' . | less\n\nPress q to exit.\nIf after all of this you still can't find your bearings, add a comment in the bug asking for more information.\nHow do you know that you have found what you were looking for?\nThere are a few options to confirm that you found the right files:\nIf this is about changing a string...\nEdit the file(s), and change the string (e.g. fix a typo). Rebuild, and run again:\n./mach build\n./mach run\n\nThen go to the panel that displays the string you wanted to change.\nDoes the typo still occur? Or is the string being displayed the correct one now?\nIf this is about changing JavaScript code...\nIf you think you found the right file to edit, add some logging statement on a place of the code which is likely to be executed (for example, on a class constructor):\n// For front-end code\nconsole.log('hello friends\\n');\n\n// Sometimes it's hard to spot your output. Emojis can help here really well.\nconsole.log('üëóüëóüëó', 'This is your logged output!');\n\nOr...\n// For server code\ndump('hello friends\\n');\n\nTIP: Whether to use one or another depends on the type of bug you're working on, but if you've just started in DevTools, it's highly likely you'll take a front-end bug first.\nThen rebuild and run again:\n./mach build\n./mach run\n\nGo to the panel or initiate the action that is likely to result on the code being executed, and pay close attention to the output in your console.\nCan you see hello friends? Then you found the file that you were looking for.\nIt's possible that you'll get a lot of other messages you don't care about now, but we can use grep to filter:\n./mach run | grep hello friends\n\nThis will only show lines that contain hello friends. If you get an empty output after trying to get the code to execute, maybe this isn't the right file, or maybe you didn't trigger the action.\nAnd that means it's time to ask for more information in the bug or from your colleagues. Tell them what you tried, so they don't have to figure that out themselves (saves everyone some time!).\nIf this is about changing CSS code...\nIf you think you have found the right file and the right CSS selector, you could try to edit the file to insert some outrageously colourful rule (for example, a really thick bright blue border), then restart DevTools to see if the changes show up.\nborder: 4px solid blue;\n\nNEXT: do whatever needs doing\nThis will always depend on the specific bug you're working on, so it's hard to provide guidance here.\nThe key aspect here is that if you have questions, you should not hesitate to ask. Ask your mentor, your manager, or get in touch. You should just not get stuck.\nSome people find it difficult to recognise or even admit they're in such a situation, so some ways to describe 'stuck' could be:\n\nyou've tried everything you could think of, nothing works, and do not know what else to do.\nyou have various ideas for things that can be done, and do not know which one to go for.\nyou have not learned anything new about the problem in the last one or two days.\nyou're starting to think about abandoning this bug and doing something else instead.\nyou don't know what to do, but are afraid of asking for help.\n\nIf you think any of the above describes you, ask for help!\nAnother tip you can use if you're afraid that you're wasting people's time is to timebox. For example, give yourself 2 hours to investigate. If you can't figure anything after that time has elapsed, stop and ask for help. It might be that you needed a key piece of information that was missing in the bug description, or you misunderstood something, or maybe even that you found a bug and that's why things didn't work even if they should!

In addition, contrary to what you might have seen in other open source projects, code is not pushed directly to the repository. Instead, once the code is approved by reviewers, they will request the code to be landed on the repository.\nAll this can be done somehow manually, but we have infrastructure in place to help us with reviews and landing code.\nLearn about how to get started with getting your code reviewed and landed in our setting up guide.\nAnd read on to learn about why and how we do code reviews.\nWhy do we do code reviews?\nQuality\nDoing code reviews helps with correctness. It gives us a chance to check that the code:\n\nfixes the problem,\ndoesn't have bugs,\ndoesn't regress other things,\ncovers edge cases.\n\nA review is also a chance for the reviewer to check that the right test coverage is here, that the change doesn't have performance problems, that it simplifies hard to understand code and that it comes with code comments and adequate documentation.\nLearning and sharing knowledge\nWhile going through the process of doing a code review, both the reviewer and the reviewee will be learning something (a new part of the code, a new efficient way to write code, tests, localization, etc.).\nMaking the code easy to understand by the reviewer helps everybody.\nDoing reviews also helps people working on DevTools feel more comfortable and learn about new parts of the codebase.\nIt helps build consensus around ideas and practices.\nMaintenance\nDoing reviews gives us an opportunity to check we are willing to maintain and support the new code that being introduced for a feature or bug fix.\nCode consistency\nIt is also a great opportunity for us to check that whatever new code is being written is consistent with what already exists in the code base.\nShared responsibility\nApproving a code review means that you are the second person who thinks this change is correct and a good idea. Doing this makes you responsible for the code change just as much as the author.\nIt is the entire DevTools group who owns the code, not just the author. We write code as a group, not as individuals, because on the long-term it's the group that maintains it.\nHaving a review discussion shares the ownership of the code, because authors and reviewers all put a little bit of themselves in it, and the code that results isn't just the result of one person's work\nWhat should be avoided in code reviews?\n\nStyle nits that a linter should ideally handle.\nRequests that are outside of the scope of the bug.\n\nWhat are some good practices for code reviews?\nUse empathetic language.\nMore reading:\n\nMindful Communication in Code Reviews\nHow to Do Code Reviews Like a Human\n\nPrefer smaller commits over large monolithic commits.\nIt makes it easier for the reviewer to provide a quality review. It's also easier to get consensus on the change if that change is small. Finally, it's easier to understand the risk, and find regressions.\nBe explicit\nSpecifically, be explicit about required versus optional changes.\nReviews are conversations, and the reviewee should feel comfortable on discussing and pushing back on changes before making them.\nBe quick\nAs a reviewer, strive to answer in a couple of days, or at least under a week.\nIf that is not possible, please update the bug to let the requester know when you'll get to the review. Or forward it to someone else who has more time.\nAsk for help\nKnow when you're out of your comfort zone as a reviewer, and don't hesitate to ask for an extra review to someone else.\nIt's fine, you can't know everything, and the more people participate, the more everybody learns, and the more bugs we avoid.\nHow do we communicate?\nFirst and foremost, like in any Mozilla-run platforms or events, please abide by the Community Participation Guidelines.\nMaintainers should lead by example through their tone and language. We want to build an inclusive and safe environment for working together.\nAs a reviewer, double-check your comments. Just because you're a reviewer and think you have a better solution doesn't mean that's true. Assume the code author has spent more time thinking about this part of the code than you have (if you're the reviewer) and might actually be right, even if you originally thought something was wrong. It doesn't take long to look up the code and double-check.\nBeing inclusive is highly important. We shouldn't make any assumptions about the person requesting a review, or about the person you're asking a review from, and always provide as much information as required, in a way that is as inclusive as possible.\nThe bug will live forever online, and many people will read it long after the author and reviewers are done.\nTalking over video/IRC/Slack is a great way to get buy-in and share responsibility over a solution. It is also helpful to resolve disagreement and work through issues in a more relaxed environment.\nDo not criticize the reviewee, talk about the quality of the code on its own, and not directly how the reviewee wrote the code.\nTake the time to thank and point out good code changes.\nUsing \"please\" and ‚Äúwhat do you think?‚Äù goes a long way in making others feel like colleagues, and not subordinates.\n"},"contributing/code-reviews-setup.html":{"url":"contributing/code-reviews-setup.html","title":"Set up for code reviews","keywords":"","body":"Set up for code reviews\nThere are two things you need to do before you can get a code review, although you only need to do this once üòÉ\nSet up to get code reviews in Phabricator\nWe use an online tool called Phabricator for code reviews.

Squashing means merging multiple commits into one in case you created multiple commits while working on a bug. Squashing bugs is easy!\nWe will use the histedit extension for squashing commits in Mercurial. You can check if this extension is enabled in your Mercurial installation following these steps:\n\nOpen .hgrc (Linux/OSX) or Mercurial.ini (Windows) ‚Äìthis is the default configuration file of Mercurial‚Äì located in your home directory, using your favourite editor.\nThen add histedit= under the [extensions] list present in file, if not present already.\n\nThen, run the following command:\nhg histedit\nYou will see something like this on your terminal:\npick 3bd22d1cc59a 0 \"First-Commit-Message\"\npick 81c4d40e57d3 1 \"Second-Commit-Message\"\nThese lines represent your commits. Suppose we want to merge 81c4d40e57d3 to 3bd22d1cc59a. Then replace pick in front of 81c4d40e57d3 with fold (or simply 'f'). Save the changes.\nYou will see that 81c4d40e57d3 has been combined with 3bd22d1cc59a. You can verify this using the hg log command.\nYou can fold as many commits you want, and they will be combined with the first commit above them which does not use fold.\n"},"contributing/code-reviews-checklist.html":{"url":"contributing/code-reviews-checklist.html","title":"Reviews checklist","keywords":"","body":"Code reviews checklist\nThis checklist is primarily aimed at reviewers, as it lists important points to check while reviewing a patch.\nIt can also be useful for patch authors: if the changes comply with these guidelines, then it's more likely the review will be approved.\nBug status and patch file\n\nBug status is assigned, and assignee is correctly set.\nCommit title and message follow the conventions.\nCommit message says what is being changed and why.\nPatch applies locally to current sources with no merge required.\nCheck that every new file introduced by the patch has the proper Mozilla license header: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/headers/\n\nManual testing\n\nVerify:\nif it's a new feature, the patch implements it.\nif it's a fix, the patch fixes the bug it addresses.\n\n\nReport any problems you find in the global review comment.\nDecide if any of those problems should block landing the change, or if they can be filed as follow-up bugs instead, to be fixed later.\n\nAutomated testing\n\nRun new/modified tests, with and without e10s.\nWatch out for tests that pass but log exceptions or end before protocol requests are handled.\nWatch out for slow/long tests: suggest many small tests rather than single long tests.\nWatch out for new tests written as integration tests instead of as unit tests: unit tests should be the preferred option, when possible.\n\nCode review\n\nCode changes:\nReview only what was changed by the contributor.\nCode formatting follows our ESLint rules and coding standards.\nCode is properly commented, JSDoc is updated, new \"public\" methods all have JSDoc, see the comment guidelines.\nIf Promise code was added/modified, the right promise syntax is used and rejections are handled.

Here's our guide to install and configure it.\nFor quick reference, here are some of the main code style rules:\n\nfile references to browser globals such as window and document need /* eslint-env browser */ at the top of the file,\nlines should be 90 characters maximum,\nindent with 2 spaces (no tabs!),\ncamelCasePlease,\ndon't open braces on the next line,\ndon't name function expressions: let o = { doSomething: function doSomething() {} };,\nuse a space before opening paren for anonymous functions, but don't use one for named functions:\nanonymous functions: function () {}\nnamed functions: function foo() {}\nanonymous generators: function* () {}\nnamed generators: function* foo() {}\n\n\naim for short functions, 24 lines max (ESLint has a rule that checks for function complexity too),\naArguments aAre the aDevil (don't use them please),\n\"use strict\"; globally per module,\nsemicolons; // use them,\nno comma-first,\nconsider using Task.jsm (Task.async, Task.spawn) for nice-looking asynchronous code instead of formatting endless .then chains,\nuse ES6 syntax:\nfunction setBreakpoint({url, line, column}) { ... },\n(...args) => { } rest args are awesome, no need for arguments,\nfor..of loops,\n\n\ndon't use non-standard SpiderMonkey-only syntax:\nno for each loops,\nno function () implicitReturnVal,\ngetters / setters require { },\n\n\nonly import specific, explicitly-declared symbols into your namespace:\nconst { foo, bar } = require(\"foo/bar\");,\nconst { foo, bar } = ChromeUtils.import(\"...\");,\n\n\nuse Maps, Sets, WeakMaps when possible,\nuse template strings whenever possible to avoid concatenation, allow multi-line strings, and interpolation.\n\nComments\nCommenting code is important, but bad comments can hurt too, so it's important to have a few rules in mind when commenting:\n\nIf the code can be rewritten to be made more readable, then that should be preferred over writing an explanation as a comment.\nInstead of writing a comment to explain the meaning of a poorly chosen variable name, then rename that variable.\nAvoid long separator comments like // ****************** another section below **********. They are often a sign that you should split a file in multiple files.\nLine comments go above the code they are commenting, not at the end of the line.\nSentences in comments start with a capital letter and end with a period.\nWatch out for typos.\nObsolete copy/pasted code hurts, make sure you update comments inside copy/pasted code blocks.\nA global comment at the very top of a file explaining what the file is about and the major types/classes/functions it contains is a good idea for quickly browsing code.\nIf you are forced to employ some kind of hack in your code, and there's no way around it, then add a comment that explains the hack and why it is needed. The reviewer is going to ask for one anyway.\nBullet points in comments should use stars aligned with the first comment to format each point// headline comment\n// * bullet point 1\n// * bullet point 2\n\n\n\nAsynchronous code\nA lot of code in DevTools is asynchronous, because a lot of it relies on connecting to the DevTools server and getting information from there in an asynchronous fashion.\nIt's easy to make mistakes with asynchronous code, so here are a few guidelines that should help:\n\nPrefer promises over callbacks.\nUse the new Promise(() => {}) syntax.\nDon't forget to catch rejections by defining a rejection handler: promise.then(() => console.log(\"resolved\"), () => console.log(\"rejected\")); or promise.catch(() => console.log(\"rejected\"));.\nMake use of Tasks and generator functions to make asynchronous code look synchronous. \n\nReact & Redux\nThere are React-specific code style rules in the .eslintrc file.\nComponents\n\nDefault to creating components as stateless function components. \nIf you need local state or lifecycle methods, use React.createClass instead of functions.\nUse React.DOM to create native elements. Assign it to a variable named dom, and use it like dom.div({}, dom.span({})). You may also destructure specific elements directly: const { div, ul } = React.DOM.\n\nPropTypes\n\nUse PropTypes to define the expected properties of your component. Each directly accessed property (or child of a property) should have a corresponding PropType.\nUse isRequired for any required properties.\nPlace the propTypes definition at the top of the component. If using a stateless function component, place it above the declaration of the function.\nWhere the children property is used, consider validating the children.\n\n"},"contributing/eslint.html":{"url":"contributing/eslint.html","title":"ESLint","keywords":"","body":"Using ESLint in DevTools\n\nThe main rule set is in devtools/.eslintrc. It is meant to be used with ESLint 3.5.0.\nNote that the file .eslintignore at the root of the repository contains a list of paths to ignore. This is because a lot of the code isn't ESLint compliant yet. We're in the process of making code free of ESLint warnings and errors, but this takes time. In the meantime, make sure the file or folder you are running ESLint on isn't ignored.\nInstalling\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nESLint, eslint-plugin-html, eslint-plugin-mozilla and eslint-plugin-react will be automatically downloaded and installed.\nRunning ESLint\nFrom the command line\nThe preferred way of running ESLint from the command line is by using mach like this:\n./mach eslint path/to/directory\n\nThis ensures that ESLint runs with the same configuration that our CI environment (see the next section).\nIn continuous integration\nRelying only on people to run ESLint isn't enough to guarantee new warnings or errors aren't introduced in the code. Therefore, ESLint also runs automatically in our Continuous Integration environment.\nThis means that every time a commit is pushed to one of the repositories, a job runs ESLint on the whole code.\nIf you are pushing a patch to the try repository to run the tests, then you can also tell it to run the ESLint job and therefore verify that you did not introduce new errors.\nIf you build on all platforms, then the ESLint job will run by default, but if you selected a few platforms only in your  trysyntax, then you need to also add eslint-gecko as a target platform for ESLint to run.\nRunning ESLint in SublimeText\nSublimeText is a popular code editor and it supports ESLint via a couple of plugins. Here are some pointers to get started:\n\nmake sure you have SublimeText 3, the linter plugin doesn't work with ST2,\ninstall SublimeLinter 3, this is a framework for linters that supports, among others, ESLint. Installing SublimeLinter via Package Control is the easiest way)\nwith SublimeLinter installed, you can now install the specific ESLint plugin. The installation instructions provide details about how to install node, npm, eslint which are required).\nmake sure to configure SublimeLinter with the --no-ignore option so that errors are also shown for source files that are ignored. To do this, open the SublimeLinter user configuration at: Preferences / Package Settings / SublimeLinter / Settings - User, and add \"args\": \"--no-ignore\" to the eslint linter object.\n\nYou will also need to point SublimeLinter at the local eslint installation by setting the path to whatever ./mach eslint --setup gives you when you run it (include a trailing slash but remove the eslint binary filename) e.g.\nNOTE: Your local eslint binary is at /some-project-path/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint\n    \"paths\": {\n        \"linux\": [],\n        \"osx\": [\n            \"/some-project-path/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin\"\n        ],\n        \"windows\": [\n            \"C:\\\\some-project-path\\\\tools\\\\lint\\\\eslint\\\\node_modules\\\\.bin\"\n        ]\n    },\nOnce done, open the mozilla project in SublimeText and open any JS file in the /devtools directory. You can then trigger the linter via the contextual menu (right click on the file itself) or with a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+option+L on Mac).\nYou should see errors and warnings in the gutter as shown in the screenshot below. You can also see all errors listed with ctrl+option+A, and individual errors by clicking in the gutter marker.\n\nRunning ESLint in Emacs\n\nFirst, install the flycheck package (flymake doesn't support ESLint yet).  You can get flycheck from the marmalade or melpa-stable repositories.\n\nTell flycheck to disable jslint, and enable flycheck in your javascript mode.  Some care is needed to find the eslint installed in the source tree.  This snippet assumes the built-in javascript mode, but with minor changes (just the name of the hook) should work fine with js2-mode as well:\n(defun my-js-mode-hacks ()\n(setq-local mode-name \"JS\")\n;; Set this locally so that the head.js rule continues to work\n;; properly.  In particular for a mochitest we want to preserve the\n;; \"browser_\" prefix.\n(when (buffer-file-name)\n  (let ((base (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))))\n    (when (string-match \"^\\\\([a-z]+_\\\\)\" base)\n  (setq-local flycheck-temp-prefix (match-string 1 base))))\n  (let ((base-dir (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name)\n                      \".eslintignore\")))\n    (when base-dir\n  (let ((eslint (expand-file-name\n             \"tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint\" base-dir)))\n    (when (file-exists-p eslint)\n      (setq-local flycheck-javascript-eslint-executable eslint))))))\n(flycheck-mode 1))\n(require 'flycheck)\n(setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers\n        (append flycheck-disabled-checkers\n            '(javascript-jshint)))\n(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'my-js-mode-hacks)\n\n\nflycheck puts its bindings on C-c ! by default, so use C-c ! C-h to see what is available.  There are key bindings to list all the errors and to move through the errors, among other things.\n\nTo make sure flycheck is finding eslint, open a .js file and run M-x flycheck-verify-setup. It should show the path to your eslint installation.\n\nRunning ESLint in Atom\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nInstall the linter-eslint package v.8.00 or above. Then go to the package settings and enable the following options:\n\nOnce done, you should see errors and warnings as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nRunning ESLint in ViM\nIf you don't use Syntastic yet, the instructions here should get you started: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/Hacking#Vim\nAlternatively, if you do use Syntastic already, add this to your .vimrc to get ESLint working where the path contains mozilla-central (adjust the path to reflect the one in your computer):\n autocmd FileType javascript,html\n    \\ if stridx(expand(\"%:p\"), \"/mozilla-central/\") != -1 |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_checkers = ['eslint'] |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_eslint_exec = '/path/to/mozilla-central/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint' |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_html_eslint_args = ['--plugin', 'html'] |\n    \\ endif\n\nYou probably need to close and reopen ViM for the changes to take effect. Then, open any file and try to edit it to cause an error, then save it. If all goes well, you will get some distinctive arrows pointing to the error. Hovering with the mouse will produce a sort of tooltip with more information about the error.\nRunning ESLint in Visual Studio Code\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nInstall the dbaeumer.vscode-eslint package. Then go to the package settings and set the following option:\n\"eslint.nodePath\": \"tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin\"\nOnce done, you should see errors and warnings as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nFixing ESLint Errors\nThis should help you write eslint-clean code:\n\nWhen moving or refactoring a piece of code, consider this as an opportunity to remove all ESlint errors from this piece of code. In fact, it may even be a good opportunity to remove all ESLint errors from the entire file.\nWhen doing ESLint-only changes, please do them in a separate patch from the actual functionality changes or bug fix. This helps make the review easier, and isolate the actual changes when looking at the source history.\nWhen cleaning an entire file or folder from ESLint errors, do not forget to remove the corresponding entry from the .eslintignore file.\nWhen writing new code, from scratch, please make it ESLint compliant from the start. This is a lot easier than having to revisit it later.\nESLint also runs on  tags in HTML files, so if you create new HTML test files for mochitests for example, make sure that JavaScript code in those files is free of ESLint errors.\nDepending on how a dependency is loaded into a file, the symbols this dependency exports might not be considered as defined by ESLint. For instance, using Cu.import(\"some.jsm\") doesn't explicitly say which symbols are now available in the scope of the file, and so using those symbols will be consider by ESLint as using undefined variables. When this happens, please avoid using the /* globals ... */ ESLint comment (which tells it that these variables are defined). Instead, please use /* import-globals-from relative/path/to/file.js */. This way, you won't have a list of variables to maintain manually, the globals are going to be imported dynamically instead.\nIn test files (xpcshell and mochitest), all globals from the corresponding head.js file are imported automatically, so you don't need to define them using a /* globals ... */ comment or a /* import-globals-from head.js */ comment.\n\n"},"contributing/css.html":{"url":"contributing/css.html","title":"CSS","keywords":"","body":"CSS\nThis page is for information about CSS used by DevTools. Wondering about the Dev Edition theme? See this page for more information about the Developer Edition theme.\nBasics\nThe CSS code is in devtools/client/themes.\nHere are some basic tips that can optimize reviews if you are changing CSS:\n\nAvoid !important but if you have to use it, make sure it's obvious why you're using it (maybe with a comment).\nAvoid magic numbers, prefer automatic sizing.\nAvoid platforms specific styles, put everything in the shared directory.\nAvoid preprocessor variables, use CSS variables instead.\nAvoid setting styles in JavaScript. It's generally better to set a class and then specify the styles in CSS\nclassList is generally better than className. There's less chance of over-writing an existing class.\n\nBoilerplate\nMake sure each file starts with the standard copyright header (see License Boilerplate).\nTesting\nCSS changes should generally be similar across platforms since they used a shared implementation, but there can still be differences worth checking out. Check major changes on Windows, OS X and Ubuntu.\nFormatting\nWe use 2-spaces indentation for the CSS.\nIn general the formatting looks like this:\nselector,\nalternate-selector {\n  property: value;\n  other-property: other-value;\n}\n\n\nAlso:\n\nOmit units on 0 values.\nExample: Use margin: 0;, not margin: 0px;.\n\n\nAdd a space after each comma, except within color functions.\nExample: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 1px, rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 1px).\n\n\nAlways add a space before !important.\nAssume =\"true\" in attribute selectors.\nExample: Use option[checked], not option[checked=\"true\"].\n\n\nUse longhand versions of properties so it's clear what you're changing.\nExample: Use border-color: red, not border: red;.\n\n\n\nNaming standards for class names:\n\nlower-case-with-dashes is the most common.\nBut camelCase is also used sometimes. Try to follow the style of existing or related code.\n\nLight and Dark theme support\nDevTools supports 2 different themes: the dark theme and the light theme. In order to support them, there are 2 class names available (theme-dark and theme-light).\n\nUse pre-defined CSS variables instead of hardcoding colors when possible.\nIf you need to support themes and the pre-defined variables don't fit, define a variable with your custom colors at the beginning of the CSS file. This avoids selector duplication in the code.\n\nExample:\n.theme-light {\n  --some-variable-name: ;\n}\n.theme-dark {\n  --some-variable-name: ;\n}\n#myElement {\n  background-color: var(--some-variable-name);\n}\n\nHDPI support\nIt's recommended to use SVG since it keeps the CSS clean when supporting multiple resolutions. However, if only 1x and 2x PNG assets are available, you can use this @media query to target higher density displays (HDPI): @media (min-resolution: 1.1dppx). \nPerformance\n\nRead Writing Efficient CSS.\nUse an iframe where possible so your rules are scoped to the smallest possible set of nodes.\nIf your CSS is used in browser.xhtml, you need to take special care with performance:\nDescendent selectors should be avoided.\nIf possible, find ways to use only id selectors, class selectors and selector groups.\n\n\n\nLocalization\nText Direction\n\nFor margins, padding and borders, use inline-start/inline-end rather than left/right.\nExample: Use margin-inline-start: 3px; not margin-left: 3px.\n\n\nFor RTL-aware positioning (left/right), use inset-inline-start/end.\nWhen there is no special RTL-aware property (eg. float: left|right) available, use the pseudo :-moz-locale-dir(ltr|rtl) (for XUL files) or :dir(ltr|rtl) (for HTML files).\nRemember that while a tab content's scrollbar still shows on the right in RTL, an overflow scrollbar will show on the left.\nWrite padding: 0 3px 4px; instead of padding: 0 3px 4px 3px;. This makes it more obvious that the padding is symmetrical (so RTL won't be an issue).\n\nRTL support for html modules\nBy default, new HTML modules support only left-to-right (LTR) and do not reuse the current direction of the browser.\nTo enable right-to-left (RTL) support in a module, set the [dir] attribute on the document element of the module:\n\nExample: .\n\nThe appropriate value for the dir attribute will then be set when the toolbox loads this module.\nTesting\nThe recommended workflow to test RTL on DevTools is to use the Force RTL extension. After changing the direction using Force RTL, you should restart DevTools to make sure all modules apply the new direction. A future version of Force RTL will be able to update dynamically all DevTools documents. \nGoing to about:config and setting intl.uidirection.en to rtl is not recommended, and will always require to re-open DevTools to have any impact.\nToggles\nSometimes you have a style that you want to turn on and off. For example a tree twisty (a expand-collapse arrow), a tab background, etc.\nThe Mozilla way is to perform the toggle using an attribute rather than a class:\n.tree-node {\n  background-image: url(right-arrow.svg);\n}\n.tree-node[open] {\n  background-image: url(down-arrow.svg);\n}\n\nTips\n\nUse :empty to match a node that doesn't have children.\nUsually, if margin or padding has 4 values, something is wrong. If the left and right values are asymmetrical, you're supposed to use -start and -end. If the values are symmetrical, use only 3 values (see localization section).\n\n"},"contributing/filing-good-bugs.html":{"url":"contributing/filing-good-bugs.html","title":"Filing good bugs","keywords":"","body":"Filing good bugs\nGetting started working on a bug can be hard, specially if you lack context.\nThis guide is meant to provide a list of steps to provide the necessary information to resolve a bug. \n\nUse a descriptive title.

If you don't increase it, you may easily miss data and only see last couple of seconds of your recording.\nTo increase the buffer size, click on the profiler add-on icon, in the Firefox toolbar, and set it to 360MB, like this:\n  \nThe other setting worth mentioning for DevTools debugging is the Interval\nThe profiler records only samples, based on this Interval.\nIf you want to see more fine-grained stack traces, you may reduce this interval to 0.1ms,\nbut do that only if you really need it, as it will make Firefox much even slower when recording,\nand the measured times will be even slower.\nThe DevTools UI runs on the parent process\nWhen you are debugging tool front-ends (e.g. panels), always ensure you select the Main Thread line.\nIt should have a light blue background like this:\n  \nOtherwise, the vast majority of DevTools backend (DevToolsServer, actors, ...) lives in content processes.\nSo if you are debugging them, you should select one of the Content lines.\nMost of the DevTools codebase is in Javascript\nIn the call tree, it is easier to filter by JS, via this menu list:\n  \nBut note that you may have to switch back to Combined in order to understand why some particular Javascript method is slow.\nHandy filter strings for DevTools:\n\nrequire\nHelps highlighting the cost of module loading\n \nDevTools uses two kind of URLs:\nchrome://devtools/ for all panel documents. Filter with this to see the cost of all panel documents:\n\nresource://devtools/ for all javascript modules. Filter with this to see the cost of all modules:\n\n\n\n\nRecord durations manually\nSometimes it is handy to focus on a very precise piece of code and record its time manually.\nFor example when you identified one slow running method and think you can speed it up.\nIt saves your from having to: record the profile, wait for the profiler to display and search for the precise method durations.\nPrint durations in your Terminal and in the Browser Console\nYou can use the Performance API, like this:\nlet start = window.performance.now();\n\n// Run the code you want to measure\n\n// Once it is done, do:\nconsole.log(\"my function took\", window.performance.now() - start, \"ms\");\nUse markers\nThe Performance API also allows recording markers, like this:\nwindow.performance.mark(\"my-function-start\");\n\n// Run the code you want to measure\n\n// Once it is done, do:\nwindow.performance.measure(\"my-function\", \"my-function-start\");\nThis marker will appear in the Marker Chart section in profiler.firefox.com, in the UserTiming lines:\n  \nYou can double click on it to make profiler.firefox.com display the record during this precise moment in time,\nand the call tree will only display what was executed during this measurement.\nPrototype quickly\nSometimes the best way to find what is slow is to comment blocks of code out\nand uncomment them one by one until you identify the culprit. And then focus on it.\nThere are few things worse than spending a long time refactoring the piece of code that was not slow to begin with!\nAssess your improvement.\nOnce you have a patch that you think improves the performance, you have to assess whether it actually improves it.\nRecord another profile\nCompare the two profiles, without and with your patch.\nThen see if the call tree reports a significant difference:\n\nA function call completely disappears in the new profile, with your fix.\nFor example you were loading a big module, and you got a frame for require(\"my/big/module\") call, and no longer see it.\nThe same function call takes xxx ms less with your patch.\n\nThis lazy loading of modules in netmonitor is a good example.\nWithout this patch, App.js was loading in 91ms and was loading MonitorPanel.js and StatisticsPanel.js as dependencies:\n  \nWith the patch, App.js loads in 47ms and only loads MonitorPanel.js:\n  \nIt highlights that:\n\nwe no longer load StatisticsPanel,\nApp is faster to load.\n\nRun performance tests\nSee if any subtest reports a improvement. Ensure that the improvement makes any sense.\nFor example, if the test is 50% faster, maybe you broke the performance test.\nThis might happen if the test no longer waits for all the operations to finish executing before completing.\nTo push your current patch to try, execute:\n./mach try fuzzy --query \"'linux64-shippable/ 'damp\" --rebuild 5\n\nIt will print in your Terminal a link to perfherder like this one:\nhttps://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/comparechooser?newProject=try&newRevision=9bef6cb13c43bbce21d40ffaea595e082a4c28db\nRunning performance tests takes time, so you should open it 30 minutes up to 2 hours later to see your results.\nSee Performance tests (DAMP) for more information about PerfHerder/try.\nLet's look at how to interpret an actual real-life set of perfherder results:\n\nThese results are related to lazy loading of modules in netmonitor.\nIt is interesting to see that this patch is a trade-off. It makes netmonitor opening significantly faster, by preventing loading many modules during its opening.\nBut it makes the page reload a bit slower as some modules that used to be loaded during netmonitor open, now have to be loaded during page reload.\n"},"contributing/react-performance-tips.html":{"url":"contributing/react-performance-tips.html","title":"Writing efficient React code","keywords":"","body":"Writing efficient React code\nIn this article we'll discuss about the various component types we can use, as\nwell as discuss some tips to make your React application faster.\nTL;DR tips\n\nPrefer props and state immutability and use PureComponent components as a default\nAs a convention, the object reference should change if and only if the inner data\nchanges.\nBe careful to never use new instance of functions as props to a Component (it's fine to use\nthem as props to a DOM element).\nBe careful to not update a reference if the inner data doesn't change.\n\n\nAlways measure before optimizing to have a real impact on\nperformance. And always measure after optimizing too, to prove your change\nhad a real impact.\n\nHow React renders normal components\nWhat's a normal component?\nAs a start let's discuss about how React renders normal plain components, that\ndon't use shouldComponentUpdate. What we call plain components here are either:\n\nclasses that extend Componentclass Application extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.content};\n  }\n}\n\n\nnormal functions that take some props as parameter and return some JSX. We\ncall these functions either Stateless Components or Functional Components.\nThis is important to understand that these Stateless Components are not\nespecially optimized in React.function Application(props) {\n  return {props.content};\n}\n\nThese functions are equivalent to classes extending Component. In\nthe rest of the article we'll especially focus on the latter. Unless otherwise\nstated everything about classes extending Component is also true for\nStateless/Functional Components.\n\nNotes on the use of JSX\nBecause we don't use a build step in mozilla-central yet, some of our\ntools don't use JSX and use factories\ninstead:\nclass Application extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return dom.div(null, this.props.content);\n  }\n}\n\nWe'll use JSX in this documentation for more clarity but this is strictly\nequivalent. You can read more on React documentation.\nThe first render\nThere's only one way to start a React application and trigger a first render:\ncalling ReactDOM.render:\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nReact will call that component's render method, and then recursively call\nevery child's render method, generating a rendering tree and then a virtual\nDOM tree. It will then render actual DOM elements to the specified container.\nSubsequent rerenders\nThere are several ways to trigger a rerender:\n\nWe call ReactDOM.render again with the same component.ReactDOM.render(\n ,\n document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\nOne component's state changes, through the use of setState.\nIf the application is using Redux, this is how Redux-connected components\ntrigger updates too.\nOne component's props change. But note that this can't happen by itself, this\nis always a consequence of the case 1 or 2 in one of its parents. So we'll\nignore this case for this chapter.\n\nWhen one of these happens, just like the initial render, React will call that\ncomponent's render method, and then recursively call every child's render\nmethod, but this time possibly with changed props compared to the previous render.\nThese recursive calls produce a new rendering tree. That's where React uses an\nalgorithm called virtual diffing or\nreconciliation to find the\nminimal set of updates to apply to the DOM. This is good because the less\nupdates to the DOM the less work the browser has to do to reflow and repaint the\napplication.\nMain sources of performance issues\nFrom this explanation we can gather that the main performance issues can\ncome from:\n\ntriggering the render process too frequently,\nexpensive render methods,\nthe reconciliation algorithm itself. The algorithm is O(n) according to React\nauthors, which means the processing duration increases linearly with the number\nof elements in the tree we compare. So a larger tree means a longer time to\nprocess.\n\nLet's dive more into each one of these issues.\nDo not render too often\nA rerender will happen after calling setState to change the\nlocal state.\nEverything that's in the state should be used in render.\nAnything in the state that's not used in render shouldn't be in the state, but\nrather in an instance variable. This way you won't trigger an update if you\nchange some internal state that you don't want to reflect in the UI.\nIf you call setState from an event handler you may call it too often.\nThis is usually not a problem because React is smart enough to merge close\nsetState calls and trigger a rerender only once per frame. Yet if your render\nis expensive (see below as well) this could lead to problems and you may want to\nuse setTimeout or other similar techniques to throttle the renders.\nKeep render methods as lean as possible\nWhen rendering a list, it's very common that we'll map this list to a list of\ncomponents. This can be costly and we might want to cut this list in several\nchunks of items or to\nvirtualize this list.\nAlthough this is not always possible or easy.\nDo not do heavy computations in your render methods. Rather do them before\nsetting the state, and set the state to the result of these computations.\nIdeally render should be a direct mirror of the component's props and state.\nNote that this rule also applies to the other methods called as part of the\nrendering process: componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate. In\ncomponentDidUpdate especially avoid synchronous reflows by getting DOM\nmeasurements, and do not call setState as this would trigger yet another\nupdate.\nHelp the reconciliation algorithm be efficient\nThe smaller the tree is, the faster the algorithm is. So it's\nuseful to limit the changes to a subtree of the full tree. Note that the use of\nshouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent alleviates this issue by cutting off\nentire branches from the rendering tree, we discuss this in more details\nbelow.\nTry to change the state as close as possible to where your UI\nshould change (close in the components tree).\nDo not forget to set key attributes when rendering a list of\nthings, which shouldn't be the\narray's indices but something that identifies the item in a predictable, unique\nand stable way. This helps the algorithm\na lot by skipping parts that likely haven't changed.\nMore documentation\nThe React documentation has a very well documented page\nexplaining the whole render and rerender process.\nshouldComponentUpdate and PureComponent: avoiding renders altogether\nReact has an optimized algorithm to apply changes. But the fastest algorithm is\nan algorithm that isn't executed at all.\nReact's own documentation about performance\nis quite complete on this subject.\nAvoiding rerenders with shouldComponentUpdate\nAs the first step of a rerender process, React calls your component's\nshouldComponentUpdate\nmethod with 2 parameters: the new props, and the new\nstate. If this method returns false, then React will skip the render process for this\ncomponent, and its whole subtree.\nclass ComplexPanel extends React.Component {\n  // Note: this syntax, new but supported by Babel, automatically binds the\n  // method with the object instance.\n  onClick = () => {\n    this.setState({ detailsOpen: true });\n  }\n\n  // Return false to avoid a render\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    // Note: this works only if `summary` and `content` are primitive data\n    // (eg: string, number) or immutable data\n    // (keep reading to know more about this)\n    return nextProps.summary !== this.props.summary\n      || nextProps.content !== this.props.content\n      || nextState.detailsOpen !== this.state.detailsOpen;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        {this.state.detailsOpen\n          ? \n          : null}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis is a very efficient way to improve your application speed, because this\navoids everything: both calling render methods for this component and the\nwhole subtree, and the reconciliation phase for this subtree.\nNote that just like the render method, shouldComponentUpdate is called once\nper render cycle, so it needs to be very lean and return as fast as possible. So\nit should execute some cheap comparisons only.\nPureComponent and immutability\nA very common implementation of shouldComponentUpdate is provided by React's\nPureComponent:\nit will shallowly check the new props and states for reference equality.\nclass ComplexPanel extends React.PureComponent {\n  // Note: this syntax, new but supported by Babel, automatically binds the\n  // method with the object instance.\n  onClick = () => {\n    // Running this repeatidly won't render more than once.\n    this.setState({ detailsOpen: true });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        {this.state.detailsOpen\n          ? \n          : null}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis has a very important consequence: for non-primitive props and states, that is\nobjects and arrays that can be mutated without changing the reference itself,\nPureComponent's inherited shouldComponentUpdate will yield wrong results and will\nskip renders where it shouldn't.\nSo you're left with one of these two options:\n\neither implement your own shouldComponentUpdate in a Component\nor (preferred) decide to make all your data structure immutable.\n\nThe latter is recommended because:\n\nIt's much simpler to think about.\nIt's much faster to check for equality in shouldComponentUpdate and in other\nplaces (like Redux' selectors).\n\nNote you could technically implement your own shouldComponentUpdate in a\nPureComponent but this is quite useless because PureComponent is nothing\nmore than Component with a default implementation for shouldComponentUpdate.\nAbout immutability\nWhat it doesn't mean\nIt doesn't mean you need to enforce the immutability using a library like\nImmutable.\nWhat it means\nIt means that once a structure exists, you don't mutate it.\nEvery time some data changes, the object reference must change as well. This\nmeans a new object or a new array needs to be created. This gives the nice\nreverse guarantee: if the object reference has changed, the data has changed.\nIt's good to go one step further to get a strict equivalence: if the data\ndoesn't change, the object reference mustn't change. This isn't necessary for\nyour app to work, but this is a lot better for performance as this avoids\nspurious rerenders.\nKeep reading to learn how to proceed.\nKeep your state objects simple\nUpdating your immutable state objects can be difficult if the objects used are\ncomplex. That's why it's a good idea to keep the objects simple, especially keep\nthem not nested, so that you don't need to use a library like\nimmutability-helper,\nupdeep, or even\nImmutable. Be especially careful\nwith Immutable as it's easy to create performance problems by misusing\nits API.\nIf you're using Redux (see below as well) this\nadvice applies to your individual reducers as well, even if Redux tools make\nit easy to have a nested/combined state.\nHow to update an object\nUpdating an object is quite easy.\nYou must not change/add/delete inner properties directly:\n// Note that in the following examples we use the callback version\n// of `setState` everywhere, because we build the new state from\n// the current state.\n\n// Please don't do this as this will likely induce bugs.\nthis.setState(state => {\n  state.stateObject.details = details;\n  return state;\n});\n\n// This is wrong too: `stateObject` is still mutated.\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => {\n  stateObject.details = details;\n  return { stateObject };\n});\n\nInstead you must create a new object for this property. In this example\nwe'll use the object spread operator, already implemented in Firefox, Chrome and Babel.\nHowever here we take care to return the same object if it doesn't need an update. The\ncomparison happens inside the callback because it depends on the state as\nwell. This is a good thing to do so that the shallow equality check doesn't\nreturn false if nothing changes.\n// Updating one property in the state\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => ({\n  stateObject: stateObject.content === newContent\n    ? stateObject\n    : { ...stateObject, content: newContent },\n});\n\n// This is very similar if 2 properties need an update:\nthis.setState(({ stateObject1, stateObject2 }) => ({\n  stateObject1: stateObject1.content === newContent\n    ? stateObject1\n    : { ...stateObject1, content: newContent },\n  stateObject2: stateObject2.details === newDetails\n    ? stateObject2\n    : { ...stateObject2, details: newDetails },\n});\n\n// Or if one of the properties needs to update 2 of it's own properties:\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => ({\n  stateObject: stateObject.content === newContent && stateObject.details === newDetails\n    ? stateObject\n    : { ...stateObject, content: newContent, details: newDetails },\n});\n\nNote that this isn't about the returned state object, but its properties.\nThe returned object is always merged into the current state, and React creates\na new component's state object at each update cycle.\nHow to update an array\nUpdating an array is easy too.\nYou must avoid methods that mutate the array like push/splice/pop/shift and you\nmust not change directly an item.\n// Please don't do this as this will likely induce bugs.\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => {\n  stateArray.push(newItem); // This is wrong\n  stateArray[1] = newItem; // This is wrong too\n  return { stateArray };\n});\n\nInstead here again you need to create a new array instance.\n// Adding an element is easy.\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => ({\n  stateArray: [...stateArray, newElement],\n}));\n\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => {\n  // Removing an element is more involved.\n  const newArray = stateArray.filter(element => element !== removeElement);\n  // or\n  const newArray = [...stateArray.slice(0, index), ...stateArray.slice(index + 1)];\n  // or do what you want on a new clone:\n  const newArray = stateArray.slice();\n  return {\n    // Because we want to keep the old array if removeElement isn't in the\n    // filtered array, we compare the lengths.\n    // We still start a render phase because we call `setState`, but thanks to\n    // PureComponent's shouldComponentUpdate implementation we won't actually render.\n    stateArray: newArray.length === stateArray.length ? stateArray : newArray,\n  };\n\n  // You can also return a falsy value to avoid the render cycle at all:\n  return newArray.length === stateArray.length\n    ? null\n    : { stateArray: newArray };\n});\n\nHow to update Maps and Sets\nThe process is very similar for Maps and Sets. Here is a quick example:\n// For a Set\nthis.setState(({ stateSet }) => {\n  if (!stateSet.has(value)) {\n    stateSet = new Set(stateSet);\n    stateSet.add(value);\n  }\n  return { stateSet };\n});\n\n// For a Map\nthis.setState(({ stateMap }) => {\n  if (stateMap.get(key) !== value) {\n    stateMap = new Map(stateMap);\n    stateMap.set(key, value);\n  }\n  return { stateMap };\n}));\n\nHow to update primitive values\nObviously, with primitive types like boolean, number or string, that are\ncomparable with the operator ===, it's much easier:\nthis.setState({\n  stateString: \"new string\",\n  stateNumber: 42,\n  stateBool: false,\n});\n\nNote that we don't use the callback version of setState here. That's because\nfor primitive values we don't need to use the previous state to generate a new\nstate.\nA few words about Redux\nWhen working with Redux, the rules stay the same, except all of this\nhappens in your reducers instead of in your components. With Redux comes the\nfunction combineReducers\nthat obeys all the rules we outlined before while making it possible to have a\nnested state.\nshouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent?\nIt is highly recommended to go the full PureComponent + immutability route,\ninstead of writing custom shouldComponentUpdate implementations for\ncomponents. This is more generic, more maintainable, less error-prone, faster.\nOf course all rules have exceptions and you're free to implement a\nshouldComponentUpdate method if you have specific cases to take care of.\nSome gotchas with PureComponent\nBecause PureComponent shallowly checks props and state, you need to take care\nto not create a new reference for something that's otherwise identical. Some\ncommon cases are:\n\nUsing a new instance for a prop at each render cycle. Especially, do not use\na bound function or an anonymous function (both classic functions or\narrow functions) as a prop:\nrender() {\n  return  this.update()} />;\n}\n\nEach time the render method runs, a new function will be created, and in\nMyComponent's shouldComponentUpdate the shallow check will always fail\ndefeating its purpose.\n\nUsing another reference for the same data. One very common example is the empty\narray: if you use a new [] for each render, you won't skip render. A solution\nis to reuse a common instance. Be careful as this can very well be hidden\nwithin some complicated Redux reducers.\n\nA similar issue can arise if you use sets or maps. If you add an element in a\nSet that's already in there, you don't need to return a new Set as it will be\nidentical.\n\nBe careful with array's methods, especially map or filter, as they always\nreturn a new array. So even with the same inputs (same input array, same\nfunction), you'll get a new output, even if it contains the same data. If\nyou're using Redux, reselect is\nrecommended.\nmemoize-immutable\ncan be useful in some cases too.\n\n\nDiagnosing performance issues with some tooling\nYou can read about it in the dedicated\npage.\nBreaking the rules: always measure first\nYou should generally follow these rules because they bring a consistent\nperformance in most cases.\nHowever you may have specific cases that will need that you break the rules. In\nthat case the first thing to do is to measure using a profiler so that you\nknow where your problem are.\nThen and only then you can decide to break the rules by using some mutable state\nand/or custom shouldComponentUpdate implementation.\nAnd remember to measure again after you did your changes, to check and prove\nthat your changes actually made an impact. Ideally you should always give links\nto profiles when requesting a review for a performance patch.\n"},"tests/":{"url":"tests/","title":"Automated tests","keywords":"","body":"Automated tests\nWhen working on a patch for DevTools, there's almost never a reason not to add a new test.

Then run yarn run test-ci -u in this folder and add the snapshot changes to your commit.\n"},"tests/writing-tests.html":{"url":"tests/writing-tests.html","title":"Writing tests","keywords":"","body":"Automated tests: writing tests\n\nAdding a new browser chrome test\nIt's almost always a better idea to create a new test file rather than to add new test cases to an existing one.\nThis prevents test files from growing up to the point where they timeout for running too long. Test systems may be under lots of stress at time and run a lot slower than your regular local environment.\nIt also helps with making tests more maintainable: with many small files, it's easier to track a problem rather than in one huge file.\nCreating the new file\nThe first thing you need to do is create a file. This file should go next to the code it's testing, in the tests directory. For example, an inspector test would go into devtools/inspector/test/.\nNaming the new file\nNaming your file is pretty important to help other people get a feeling of what it is supposed to test.\nHaving said that, the name shouldn't be too long either.\nA good naming convention is browser__[_N].js\nwhere:\n\n is one of debugger, markupview, inspector, ruleview, etc.\n should be about 3 to 4 words, separated by hyphens (-)\nand optionally add a number at the end if you have several files testing the same thing\n\nFor example: browser_ruleview_completion-existing-property_01.js\nNote that not all existing tests are consistently named. So the rule we try to follow is to be consistent with how other tests in the same test folder are named.\nBasic structure of a test\n/* Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain.\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ */\n\"use strict\";\n\n// A detailed description of what the test is supposed to test\n\nconst TEST_URL = TEST_URL_ROOT + \"doc_some_test_page.html\";\n\nadd_task(function*() {\nyield addTab(TEST_URL_ROOT);\nlet {toolbox, inspector, view} = yield openRuleView();\nyield selectNode(\"#testNode\", inspector);\nyield checkSomethingFirst(view);\nyield checkSomethingElse(view);\n});\n\nfunction* checkSomethingFirst(view) {\n/* ... do something ... this function can yield */\n}\n\nfunction* checkSomethingElse(view) {\n/* ... do something ... this function can yield */\n}\n\nReferencing the new file\nFor your test to be run, it needs to be referenced in the browser.ini file that you'll find in the same directory. For example: browser/devtools/debugger/test/browser.ini\nAdd a line with your file name between square brackets, and make sure that the list of files is always sorted by alphabetical order (some lists can be really long, so the alphabetical order helps in finding and reasoning about things).\nFor example, if you were to add the test from the previous section, you'd add this to browser.ini:\n[browser_ruleview_completion-existing-property_01.js]\n\nAdding support files\nSometimes your test may need to open an HTML file in a tab, and it may also need to load CSS or JavaScript. For this to work, you'll need to...\n\nplace these files in the same directory, and also \nreference them in the browser.ini file.\n\nThere's a naming convention for support files: doc_.html\nBut again, often names do not follow this convention, so try to follow the style of the other support files currently in the same test directory.\nTo reference your new support file, add its filename in the support-files section of browser.ini, also making sure this section is in alphabetical order.\nSupport files can be accessed via a local server that is started while tests are running. This server is accessible at http://example.com/browser/. See the head.js section below for more information.\nLeveraging helpers in head.js\nhead.js is a special support file that is loaded in the scope the test runs in, before the test starts. It contains global helpers that are useful for most tests. Read through the head.js file in your test directory to see what functions are there and therefore avoid duplicating code.\nEach panel in DevTools has its own test directory with its own head.js, so you'll find different things in each panel's head.js file.\nFor example, the head.js files in the markupview and styleinspector test folders contain these useful functions and constants:\n\nBase URLs for support files: TEST_URL_ROOT. This avoids having to duplicate the http://example.com/browser/browser/devtools/styleinspector/ URL fragment in all tests,\nwaitForExplicitFinish() is called in head.js once and for all. All tests are asynchronous, so there's no need to call it again in each and every test,\nauto-cleanup: the toolbox is closed automatically and all tabs are closed,\ntab addTab(url)\n{toolbox, inspector} openInspector()\n{toolbox, inspector, view} openRuleView()\nselectNode(selectorOrNode, inspector)\nnode getNode(selectorOrNode)\n...\n\nShared head.js file\nA shared-head.js file has been introduced to avoid duplicating code in various head.js files.\nIt's important to know whether or not the shared.js in your test directory already imports shared-head.js (look for a Services.scriptloader.loadSubScript call), as common helpers in shared-head.js might be useful for your test.\nIf you're planning to work on a lot of new tests, it might be worth the time actually importing shared-head.js in your head.js if it isn't here already.\nElectrolysis\nE10S is the codename for Firefox multi-process, and what that means for us is that the process in which the test runs isn't the same as the one in which the test content page runs.\nYou can learn more about E10S from this blog post, the Electrolysis wiki page and the page on tests and E10s.\nOne of the direct consequences of E10S on tests is that you cannot retrieve and manipulate objects from the content page as you'd do without E10S.\nSo when creating a new test, if this test needs to access the content page in any way, you can use the message manager to communicate with a script loaded in the content process to do things for you instead of accessing objects in the page directly.\nYou can use the helper ContentTask.spawn() for this. See this list of DevTools tests that use that helper for examples.\nNote that a lot of tests only need to access the DevTools UI anyway, and don't need to interact with the content process at all. Since the UI lives in the same process as the test, you won't need to use the message manager to access it.\nAsynchronous tests\nMost browser chrome DevTools tests are asynchronous. One of the reasons why they are asynchronous is that the code needs to register event handlers for various user interactions in the tools and then simulate these interactions. Another reason is that most DevTools operations are done asynchronously via the debugger protocol.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind with regards to asynchronous testing:\n\nhead.js already calls waitForExplicitFinish() so there's no need for your new test to do it too.\nUsing add_task with a generator function means that you can yield calls to functions that return promises. It also means your main test function can be written to almost look like synchronous code, by adding yield before calls to asynchronous functions. For example:\n\nfor (let test of testData) {\n    yield testCompletion(test, editor, view);\n}\n\nEach call to testCompletion is asynchronous, but the code doesn't need to rely on nested callbacks and maintain an index, a standard for loop can be used.\n\n\nDefine your test functions as generators that yield, no need for them to be tasks since they are called from one already. In some cases you'll need to return promises anyway (if you're adding a new helper function to head.js for example). If this is the case, it sometimes is best to define your function like so:\n\nlet myHelperFunction = Task.async(function*() {\n    ...\n});\n\nWriting clean, maintainable test code\nTest code is as important as feature code itself, it helps avoiding regressions of course, but it also helps understanding complex parts of the code that would be otherwise hard to grasp.\nSince we find ourselves working with test code a large portion of our time, we should spend the time and energy it takes to make this time enjoyable.\nLogs and comments\nReading test output logs isn't exactly fun and it takes time but is needed at times. Make sure your test generates enough logs by using:\ninfo(\"doing something now\")\nit helps a lot knowing around which lines the test fails, if it fails.\nOne good rule of thumb is if you're about to add a JS line comment in your test to explain what the code below is about to test, write the same comment in an info() instead.\nAlso add a description at the top of the file to help understand what this test is about. The file name is often not long enough to convey everything you need to know about the test. Understanding a test often teaches you about the feature itself.\nNot really a comment, but don't forget to \"use strict\";\nCallbacks and promises\nAvoid multiple nested callbacks or chained promises. They make it hard to read the code.\nThanks to add_task, it's easy to write asynchronous code that looks like flat, synchronous, code.\nClean up after yourself\nDo not expose global variables in your test file, they may end up causing bugs that are hard to track. Most functions in head.js return useful instances of the DevTools panels, and you can pass these as arguments to your sub functions, no need to store them in the global scope.\nThis avoids having to remember nullifying them at the end.\nIf your test needs to toggle user preferences, make sure you reset these preferences when the test ends. Do not reset them at the end of the test function though because if your test fails, the preferences will never be reset. Use the registerCleanupFunction helper instead.\nIt may be a good idea to do the reset in head.js.\nWrite small, maintainable code\nSplit your main test function into smaller test functions with self explanatory names.\nMake sure your test files are small. If you are working on a new feature, you can create a new test each time you add a new functionality, a new button to the UI for instance. This helps having small, incremental tests and can also help writing test while coding.\nIf your test is just a sequence of functions being called to do the same thing over and over again, it may be better to describe the test steps in an array instead and just have one function that runs each item of the array. See the following example\nconst TESTS = [\n    {desc: \"add a class\", cssSelector: \"#id1\", makeChanges: function*() {...}},\n    {desc: \"change href\", cssSelector: \"a.the-link\", makeChanges: function*() {...}},\n    ...\n];\n\nadd_task(function*() {\n    yield addTab(\"...\");\n    let {toolbox, inspector} = yield openInspector();\n    for (let step of TESTS) {\n      info(\"Testing step: \" + step.desc);\n      yield selectNode(step.cssSelector, inspector);\n      yield step.makeChanges();\n    }\n});\n\nAs shown in this code example, you can add as many test cases as you want in the TESTS array and the actual test code will remain very short, and easy to understand and maintain (note that when looping through test arrays, it's always a good idea to add a \"desc\" property that will be used in an info() log output).\nAvoid exceptions\nEven when they're not failing the test, exceptions are bad because they pollute the logs and make them harder to read.\nThey're also bad because when your test is run as part of a test suite and if an other, unrelated, test fails then the exceptions may give wrong information to the person fixing the unrelated test.\nAfter your test has run locally, just make sure it doesn't output exceptions by scrolling through the logs.\nOften, non-blocking exceptions may be caused by hanging protocol requests that haven't been responded to yet when the tools get closed at the end of the test. Make sure you register to the right events and give time to the tools to update themselves before moving on.\nAvoid test timeouts\n\nWhen tests fail, it's far better to have them fail and end immediately with an exception that will help fix it rather than have them hang until they hit the timeout and get killed.\nAdding new helpers\nIn some cases, you may want to extract some common code from your test to use it another another test. \n\nIf this is very common code that all tests could use, then add it to devtools/client/shared/test/shared-head.js.\nIf this is common code specific to a given tool, then add it to the corresponding head.js file.\nIf it isn't common enough to live in head.js, then it may be a good idea to create a helper file to avoid duplication anyway. Here's how to create a helper file:\nCreate a new file in your test director. The naming convention should be helper_.js\nAdd it to the browser.ini support-files section, making sure it is sorted alphabetically\nLoad the helper file in the tests\nbrowser/devtools/markupview/test/head.js has a handy loadHelperScript(fileName) function that you can use.\nThe file will be loaded in the test global scope, so any global function or variables it defines will be available (just like head.js).\nUse the special ESLint comment /* import-globals-from helper_file.js */ to prevent ESLint errors for undefined variables.\n\n\n\nIn all cases, new helper functions should be properly commented with an jsdoc comment block.\n"},"tests/debugging-intermittents.html":{"url":"tests/debugging-intermittents.html","title":"Debugging intermittent failures","keywords":"","body":"Debugging Intermittent Test Failures\nWhat are Intermittents (aka Oranges)?\nIntermittents are test failures which happen intermittently, in a seemingly random way. Often you'll write a test that passes fine locally on your computer, but when ran thousands of times on various CI environments (some of them under heavy load) it may start to fail randomly.\nIntermittents are also known as Oranges, because the corresponding test jobs are rendered orange on treeherder.\nThese intermittent failures are tracked in Bugzilla. When a test starts being intermittent a bug is filed in Bugzilla (usually by a Mozilla code sheriff).\nOnce the bug exists for a given test failure, all further similar failures of that test will be reported as comments within that bug.\nThese reports are usually posted weekly and look like this:\n\n5 failures in 2740 pushes (0.002 failures/push) were associated with this bug in the last 7 days.\n\nSee an example here.\nSometimes, tests start failing more frequently and these reports are then posted daily.\nTo help with the (unfortunately) ever-growing list of intermittents, the Stockwell project was initiated a while ago (read more about the goals of that project on their wiki).\nThis project defines a scenario where very frequently failing tests get disabled.\nIdeally, we should try to avoid this, because this means reducing our test coverage, but sometimes we do not have time to investigate the failure, and disabling it is the only remaining option.\nFinding Intermittents\nYou will have no trouble finding out that a particular test is intermittent, because a bug for it will be filed and you will see it in Bugzilla (watching the Bugzilla component of your choice is a good way to avoid missing the failure reports).\nHowever, it can still be useful to see intermittents in context. The Intermittent Failures View on Treeherder shows intermittents ranked by frequency.\nYou can also see intermittents in Bugzilla.  Go to the settings page and enable \"When viewing a bug, show its corresponding Orange Factor page\".\nReproducing Test Failures locally\nThe first step to fix an intermittent is to reproduce it.\nSometimes reproducing the failure can only be done in automation, but it's worth trying locally, because this makes it much simpler to debug.\nFirst, try running the test in isolation.  You can use the --repeat and --run-until-failure flags to mach mochitest to automate this a bit.  It's nice to do this sort of thing in headless mode (--headless) or in a VM (or using Xnest on Linux) to avoid locking up your machine.  Mozilla provides an easy-to-use VM.\nSometimes, though, a test will only fail if it is run in conjunction with one or more other tests.  You can use the --start-at and --end-at flags with mach mochitest to run a group of tests together.\nFor some jobs, but not all, you can get an interactive shell from TaskCluster.\nThere's also a handy page of e10s test debugging tips that is worth a read.\nBecause intermittents are often caused by race conditions, it's sometimes useful to enable Chaos Mode.  This changes timings and event orderings a bit. The simplest way to do this is to enable it in a specific test, by\ncalling SimpleTest.testInChaosMode.  You can also set the MOZ_CHAOSMODE environment variable, or even edit mfbt/ChaosMode.cpp directly.\nSome tests leak intermittently. Use ac_add_options --enable-logrefcnt in your mozconfig to potentially find them.\nThe rr tool has its own chaos mode.  This can also sometimes reproduce a failure that isn't ordinarily reproducible.  While it's difficult to debug JS bugs using rr, often if you can reliably reproduce the failure you can at least experiment (see below) to attempt a fix.\nThat Didn't Work\nIf you couldn't reproduce locally, there are other options.\nOne useful approach is to add additional logging to the test, then push again.  Sometimes log buffering makes the output weird; you can add a call to SimpleTest.requestCompleteLog() to fix this.\nYou can run a single directory of tests on try using mach try DIR.  You can also use the --rebuild flag to retrigger test jobs multiple times; or you can also do this easily from treeherder.\nSolving\nIf a test fails at different places for each failure it might be a timeout.  The current mochitest timeout is 45 seconds, so if successful runs of an intermittent are ~40 seconds, it might just be a\nreal timeout.  This is particularly true if the failure is most often seen on the slower builds, for example Linux 32 debug.  In this case you can either split the test or call requestLongerTimeout somewhere at the beginning of the test (here's an example).\nSometimes the problem is a race at a specific spot in the test.  You can test this theory by adding a short wait to see if the failure goes away, like:\nyield new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));\n\nSee the waitForTick and waitForTime functions in DevToolsUtils for similar functionality.\nYou can use a similar trick to \"pause\" the test at a certain point. This is useful when debugging locally because it will leave Firefox open and responsive, at the specific spot you've chosen.  Do this\nusing yield new Promise(r => r);.\nshared-head.js also has some helpers, like once, to bind to events with additional logging.\nYou can also binary search the test by either commenting out chunks of it, or hacking in early returns.  You can do a bunch of these experiments in parallel without waiting for the first to complete.\nVerifying\nIt's difficult to verify that an intermittent has truly been fixed.\nOne thing you can do is push to try, and then retrigger the job many times in treeherder.  Exactly how many times you should retrigger depends on the frequency of the failure.\n"},"tests/performance-tests.html":{"url":"tests/performance-tests.html","title":"Performance tests (DAMP)","keywords":"","body":"Performance Tests: DAMP\nDAMP (DevTools At Maximum Performance) is our test suite to track performance.\nHow to run it locally?\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp\n\nNote that the first run is slower as it pulls a large tarball with various website copies.\nThis will run all DAMP tests, you can filter by test name with:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtests console\n\nThis command will run all tests which contains \"console\" in their name.\nCommand line options\nRunning tests only once\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1\n\n--cycles will limit the number of Firefox restart to only one, while\n--tppagecycles will limit the number of test re-run in each firefox start to one.\nThis is often helpful when debugging one particular subtest.\nTaking screenshots\nDEBUG_DEVTOOLS_SCREENSHOTS=1 ./mach talos-test --activeTests damp\n\nWhen passing DEBUG_DEVTOOLS_SCREENSHOTS env variable, screenshots will be taken after each subtest\nwas run.

This test highlights the performance of all tools against the simplest possible page.\n\"complicated\": a copy of bild.de website. This is supposed to represent a typical website to debug via DevTools.\n\nThen, there are a couple of extra tests:\n\n\"cold\": we run the three operations (open toolbox, page reload and close toolbox) first with the inspector.\nThis is run first after Firefox's startup, before any other test.\nThis test allows to measure a \"cold startup\".

Complexifying custom test pages should also help cover more scenarios and catch more regressions. For those reasons, modifying existing tests should be the preferred way of extending DAMP coverage.\ncustom tests are using complex documents that should stress a particular tool in various ways. They are all named custom.${tool} (for instance custom.inspector).

You will find subfolders for panels already tested in DAMP (debugger, inspector, ‚Ä¶) as well as other subfolders for tests not specific to a given panel (server, toolbox).\nTests are isolated in dedicated files. Some examples of tests:\n\ntests/netmonitor/simple.js\ntests/inspector/mutations.js\n\nBasic test\nThe basic skeleton of a test is:\nconst {\n  testSetup,\n  testTeardown,\n  SIMPLE_URL,\n} = require(\"devtools/docs/head\");\n\nmodule.exports = async function() {\n  await testSetup(SIMPLE_URL);\n\n  // Run some measures here\n\n  await testTeardown();\n};\n\nalways start the test by calling testSetup(url), with the url of the document to use\nalways end the test with testTeardown()\n\nTest documents\nDevTools performance heavily depends on the document against which DevTools are opened. There are two \"historical\" documents you can use for tests for any panel:\n\n\"Simple\", an empty webpage. This one helps highlighting the load time of panels,\n\"Complicated\", a copy of bild.be, a German newspaper website. This allows us to examine the performance of the tools when inspecting complicated, big websites.\n\nThe URL of those documents are exposed by tests/head.js. The Simple page can be found at testing/talos/talos/tests/devtools/addon/content/pages/simple.html. The Complicated page is downloaded via tooltool automatically the first time you run the DAMP tests.\nYou can create also new test documents under testing/talos/talos/tests/devtools/addon/content/pages. See the pages in the custom subfolder for instance. If you create a document in pages/custom/mypanel/index.html, the URL of the document in your tests should be PAGES_BASE_URL + \"custom/mypanel/index.html\". The constant PAGES_BASE_URL is exposed by head.js.\nNote that modifying any existing test document will most likely impact the baseline for existing tests.\nFinally you can also create very simple test documents using data urls. Test documents don't have to contain any specific markup or script to be valid DAMP test documents, so something as simple as testSetup(\"data:text/html,my test document\"); is valid.\nTest helpers\nHelper methods have been extracted in shared modules:\n\ntests/head.js for the most common ones\ntests/{subfolder}/{subfolder}-helpers.js for folder-specific helpers (example)\n\nTo measure something which is not covered by an existing helper, you should use runTest, exposed by head.js.\nmodule.exports = async function() {\n  await testSetup(SIMPLE_URL);\n\n  // Calling `runTest` will immediately start recording your action duration.\n  // You can execute any necessary setup action you don't want to record before calling it.\n  const test = runTest(`mypanel.mytest.mymeasure`);\n\n  await doSomeThings(); // If your measure is not simply the time spent by an asynchronous call (for instance computing an average, counting things‚Ä¶) there is a lower level helper called logTestResult which will directly log a value. See this example.\nTest runner\nIf you need to dive into the internals of the DAMP runner, most of the logic is in testing/talos/talos/tests/devtools/addon/content/damp.js.\nHow to name your test and register it?\nIf a new test file was created, it needs to be registered in the test suite. To register the new test, add it in damp-tests.js. This file acts as the manifest for the DAMP test suite.\nIf your are writing a test executing against Simple and Complicated documents, your test name will look like: (simple|complicated).${tool-name}.${test-name}.\nSo for our example, it would be simple.inspector.click and complicated.inspector.click.\nFor independent tests that don't use the Simple or Complicated documents, the test name only needs to start with the tool name, if the test is specific to that tool\nFor the example, it would be inspector.click.\nIn general, the test name should try to match the path of the test file. As you can see in damp-tests.js this naming convention is not consistently followed. We have discrepancies for simple/complicated/custom tests, as well as for webconsole tests. This is largely for historical reasons.\nHow to run your new test?\nYou can run any performance test with this command:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name}\nBy default, it will run the test 25 times. In order to run it just once, do:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name} --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1\n--cycles controls the number of times Firefox is restarted\n--tppagecycles defines the number of times we repeat the test after each Firefox start\nAlso, you can record a profile while running the test. To do that, execute:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name} --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1 --gecko-profile --gecko-profile-entries 100000000\n--gecko-profile enables the profiler\n--gecko-profile-entries defines the profiler buffer size, which needs to be large while recording performance tests\nOnce it is done executing, the profile lives in a zip file you have to uncompress like this:\nunzip testing/mozharness/build/blobber_upload_dir/profile_damp.zip\nThen you have to open https://profiler.firefox.com/ and manually load the profile file that lives here: profile_damp/page_0_pagecycle_1/cycle_0.profile\n"},"tests/writing-perf-tests-example.html":{"url":"tests/writing-perf-tests-example.html","title":"Example","keywords":"","body":"Performance test example: performance of click event in the inspector\nLet's look at a trivial but practical example and add a simple test to measure the performance of a click in the inspector.\nFirst we create a file under tests/inspector since we are writing an inspector test.

If you add a new JavaScript module, you'll need to update (or add) one of these files to make the build system aware of your new module. See the example below.\nA moz.build file must live in the same directory as the files to be installed. Don't list files from a subdirectory in a moz.build from a parent directory.\nFollowing these steps ensures that require() and resource:// paths map directly to locations in the source tree, instead of being totally arbitrary.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/server/actors/layout.js\nIn /devtools/server/actors/moz.build:\n\nDevToolsModules(\n  'layout.js'\n)\nrequire()\nMost DevTools JS code is in the form of CommonJS modules that loaded with require().\nTo require() a file, the module ID is exactly its source tree path.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/server/actors/layout.js\nUsage (prefer lazy in most cases):\nloader.lazyRequireGetter(this, \"layout\", \"devtools/server/actors/layout\")\nrequire(\"devtools/server/actors/layout\")\n\n\n\nChromeUtils.import()\nSome older DevTools JS modules use the Gecko JavaScript code module format with the file extension .jsm. We are trying to move away from this format, so it's unlikely you would add a new one, but you might need to import an existing one in your code.\nThese modules are loaded using ChromeUtils.import(). To import() a file, you provide a resource:// URL, which is exactly the source tree path.\nIn more detail:\n\n/devtools/client/: resource://devtools/client/\n/devtools/server/: resource://devtools/server/\n/devtools/shared/: resource://devtools/shared/\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/shared/Loader.jsm\nUsage:\nconst { loader } = ChromeUtils.import(\"resource://devtools/shared/Loader.jsm\")\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /toolkit/mozapps/extensions/AddonManager.jsm\nUsage (prefer lazy in most cases):\nloader.lazyImporter(this, \"AddonManager\", \"resource://gre/modules/AddonManager.jsm\")\nconst { AddonManager } = ChromeUtils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/AddonManager.jsm\")\n\n\n\nChrome Content\nMuch of the DevTools front-end / UI is currently loaded using chrome:// URLs, which allow those files to have privileged access to platform internals.\nThis is typically used to load XUL, HTML, and JS files in the UI.\nNote: \"Chrome\" here means \"browser chrome\", as in the UI, and bears no relation to \"Chrome\" as in the browser. We'd like to move away from this on DevTools and be more like regular web sites, but most tools are using chrome:// URLs for now.\nPackaging\nIf you add a new file that should be loaded via a chrome:// URL, you need to update a manifest file at /devtools/client/jar.mn so that it's packaged correctly.\nPlease ensure that any new files are added so their entire source tree path is part of the URL. To do so, the jar.mn entry should look like:\ncontent/ ()\nwhere  is the path to your file after removing the /devtools/client/ prefix.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/webaudioeditor/models.js\nEntry: content/webaudioeditor/models.js (webaudioeditor/models.js)\n\nUsage\nChrome content URLs almost match their source tree path, with one difference: the segment client is replaced by content. This is a requirement of the chrome:// protocol handler.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/webaudioeditor/models.js\nUsage: chrome://devtools/content/webaudioeditor/models.js\n\nFor files within a single tool, consider relative URLs. They're shorter!\nChrome Themes\nSimilar to the chrome content section above, we also use chrome themes (or skin URLs) in the DevTools UI. These are typically used to load CSS and images.\nPackaging\nIf you add a new file that should be loaded via chrome:// (such as a new CSS file for a tool UI), you need to update a manifest file at /devtools/client/jar.mn so that it's packaged correctly.\nPlease ensure that any new files are added so their entire source tree path is part of the URL. To do so, the jar.mn entry should look like:\nskin/ (themes/)\nwhere  is the path to your file after removing the /devtools/client/themes/ prefix.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/themes/images/add.svg\nEntry: skin/images/add.svg (themes/images/add.svg)\n\nUsage\nChrome theme URLs almost match their source tree path, with one difference: the segment client/themes is replaced by skin. This is a requirement of the chrome:// protocol handler.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/themes/images/add.svg\nUsage: chrome://devtools/skin/images/add.svg\n\nLocalization (l10n)\nSimilar to the other chrome sections above, we also use locale URLs in the DevTools UI to load localized strings. This section applies to *.dtd (for use as entities within XUL / XHTML files) and *.properties (for use via runtime APIs) files.\nWe currently have two sets of localized files:\n\ndevtools/client/locales: Strings used in the DevTools client (front-end UI)\ndevtools/shared/locales: Strings used in either the DevTools server only, or shared with both the client and server\n\nPackaging\nIf you add a new l10n file (such as a new *.dtd or *.properties file), there should not be any additional packaging steps to perform, assuming the new file is placed in either of the 2 directories mentioned above. Each one contains a jar.mn which uses wildcards to package all files in the directory by default.\nUsage\nLocale URLs differ somewhat based on whether they are in client or shared. While we would have preferred them to match the source tree path, the requirements of the chrome:// protocol don't make that easy to do.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/locales/en-US/debugger.dtd\nUsage: chrome://devtools/locale/debugger.dtd\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/shared/locales/en-US/screenshot.properties\nUsage: chrome://devtools-shared/locale/screenshot.properties\n\nGuidelines\nLocalization files should follow a set of guidelines aimed at making it easier for people to translate the labels in these files in many languages.\nFind these guidelines on MDN.\nIn particular, it's important to write self-explanatory comments for new keys, deleting unused keys, changing the key name when changing the meaning of a string, and more.

Like all tabs, it's in its own iframe.\nThe high-level hierarchy looks something like this:\n Toolbox\n    |\nInspectorPanel\n    |\n+-------------+------------------+---------------+\n|             |                  |               |\nMarkupView  SelectorSearch  HTMLBreadcrumbs  ToolSidebar widget (iframes)\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- RuleView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- ComputedView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- LayoutView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- FontInspector\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- AnimationInspector\nServer dependencies\n\nThe inspector panel relies on a series of actors that live on the server.\nSome of the most important actors are actually instantiated by the toolbox, because these actors are needed for other panels to preview and link to DOM nodes. For example, the webconsole needs to output DOM nodes, highlight them in the page on mouseover, and open them in the inspector on click. This is achieved using some of the same actors that the inspector panel uses.\nSee Toolbox.prototype.initInspector: This method instantiates the InspectorActor, WalkerActor and HighlighterActor lazily, whenever they're needed by a panel.\n\nPanel loading overview\n\nAs with other panels, this starts with Toolbox.prototype.loadTool(id)\nFor the inspector though, this calls Toolbox.prototype.initInspector\nWhen the panel's open method is called:\nIt uses the WalkerActor for the first time to know the default selected node (which could be a node that was selected before on the same page).\nIt starts listening to the WalkerActor's \"new-root\" events to know when to display a new DOM tree (when there's a page navigation).\nIt creates the breadcrumbs widget, the sidebar widget, the search widget, the markup-view\n\n\nSidebar:\nWhen this widget initializes, it loads its sub-iframes (rule-view, ...)\nEach of these iframes contain panel that, in turn, listen to inspector events like \"new-node-front\" to know when to retrieve information about a node (i.e the rule-view will fetch the css rules for a node).\n\n\nMarkup-view:\nThis panel initializes in its iframe, and gets a reference to the WalkerActor. It uses it to know the DOM tree to display. It knows when nodes change (markup-mutations), and knows what root node to start from.\nIt only displays the nodes that are supposed to be visible at first (usually html, head, body and direct children of body).\nThen, as you expand nodes, it uses the WalkerActor to get more nodes lazily. It only ever knows data about nodes that have already been expanded once in the UI.\n\n\n\nServer-side structure\nSimplified actor hierarchy\nInspectorActor\n     |\n+---------------+\n|               |\nWalkerActor    PageStyleActor (for rule-view/computed-view)\n|               |\nNodeActor      StyleRuleActor\nInspectorActor\nThis tab-level actor is the one the inspector-panel connects to. It doesn't do much apart from creating and returning the WalkerActor and PageStyleActor.\nWalkerActor\n\nSingle most important part of the inspector panel.\nResponsible for walking the DOM on the current page but:\nalso walks iframes\nalso finds pseudo-elements ::before and ::after\nalso finds anonymous content (e.g. in the BrowserToolbox)\n\n\nThe actor uses an instance of inIDeepTreeWalker to walk the DOM\nProvides a tree of NodeActor objects that reflects the DOM.\nBut only has a partial knowledge of the DOM (what is currently displayed/expanded in the MarkupView). It doesn't need to walk the whole tree when you first instantiate it.\nReflects some of the usual DOM APIs like querySelector.\nNote that methods like querySelector return arbitrarily nested NodeActors, in which case the WalkerActor also sends the list of parents to link the returned nodes to the closest known nodes, so the UI can display the tree correctly.\nEmits events when there are DOM mutations. These events are sent to the front-end and used to, for example refresh the markup-view. This uses an instance of MutationObserver (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) configured with, in particular, nativeAnonymousChildList set to true, so that mutation events are also sent when pseudo elements are added/removed via css.\n\nNodeActor\n\nRepresentation of a single DOM node (tagname, namespace, attributes, parent, sibblings, ...), which panels use to display previews of nodes.\nAlso provide useful methods to:\nchange attributes\nscroll into view\nget event listeners data\nget image data\nget unique css selector\n\n\n\nHighlighters\nOne of the important aspects of the inspector is the highlighters.\nYou can find a lot more documentation about highlighters here.\nWe don't just have 1 highlighter, we have a framework for highlighters:\n\na (chrome-only) platform API to inject markup in a native-anonymous node in content (that works on all targets)\na number of specific highlighter implementations (css transform, rect, selector, geometry, rulers, ...)\na CustomHighlighterActor to get instances of specific highlighters\n\n"},"tools/highlighters.html":{"url":"tools/highlighters.html","title":"Highlighters","keywords":"","body":"Highlighters\nThis article provides technical documentation about DevTools highlighters.\nBy highlighter, we mean anything that DevTools displays on top of the content page, in order to highlight an element, a set of elements or shapes to users.\nThe most obvious form of highlighter is the box-model highlighter, whose job is to display the 4 box-model regions on top of a given element in the content page, as illustrated in the following screen capture:\n\nBut there can be a wide variety of highlighters. In particular, highlighters are a pretty good way to give detailed information about:\n\nthe exact form of a css shape,\nhow a css transform applied to an element,\nwhich are all the elements that match a given selector,\n...\n\nUsing highlighters\nHighlighters run on the debuggee side, not on the toolbox side. This is so that it's possible to highlight elements on a remote device for instance. This means you need to go through the Remote Debugging Protocol to use a highlighter.\nThe InspectorFront provides the following method:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngetHighlighterByType(typeName)\nInstantiate a new highlighter, given its type (as a String). At the time of writing, the available types of highlighters are: CssGridHighlighter, BoxModelHighlighter, CssTransformHighlighter, FlexboxHighlighter, FontsHighlighter, GeometryEditorHighlighter, MeasuringToolHighlighter, PausedDebuggerOverlay, RulersHighlighter, SelectorHighlighter and ShapesHighlighter. This returns a promise that resolves to the new instance of protocol.js actor.\n\n\n\nThe highlighter API\nWhen getting a highlighter via InspectorFront.getHighlighterByType(typeName), the right type of highlighter will be instantiated on the server-side and will be wrapped into a CustomHighlighterActor and that's what will be returned to the caller. This means that all types of highlighters share the same following API:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nshow(NodeActor node[, Object options])\nHighlighters are hidden by default. Calling this method is what makes them visible. The first, mandatory, parameter should be a NodeActor. NodeActors are what the WalkerActor return. It's easy to get a NodeActor for an existing DOM node. For example toolbox.walker.querySelector(toolbox.walker.rootNode, \"css selector\") resolves to a NodeFront (the client-side version of the NodeActor) which can be used as the first parameter. The second, optional, parameter depends on the type of highlighter being used.\n\n\nhide()\nHides the highlighter.\n\n\nfinalize()\nDestroys the highlighter.\n\n\n\nCreating new highlighters\nBefore digging into how one goes about adding a new type of highlighter to the DevTools, it is worth understanding how are highlighters displayed in the page.\nInserting content in the page\nHighlighters use web technology themselves to display the required information on screen. For instance, the box-model highlighter uses SVG to draw the margin, border, padding and content regions over the highlighted node.\nThis means the highlighter content needs to be inserted in the page, but in a non-intrusive way. Indeed, the DevTools should never alter the page unless the alteration was done by the user (like changing the DOM using the inspector or a CSS rule via the style-editor for example). So simply appending the highlighter's markup in the content document is not an option.\nFurthermore, highlighters not only need to work with Firefox Desktop, but they should work just as well on Firefox OS, Firefox for Android, and more generally anything that runs the Gecko rendering engine. Therefore appending the highlighter's markup to the browser chrome XUL structure isn't an option either.\nTo this end, DevTools highlighters make use of a (chrome-only) API:\n /**\n  * Chrome document anonymous content management.\n  * This is a Chrome-only API that allows inserting fixed positioned anonymous\n  * content on top of the current page displayed in the document.\n  * The supplied content is cloned and inserted into the document's CanvasFrame.\n  * Note that this only works for HTML documents.\n  */\n partial interface Document {\n   /**\n    * Deep-clones the provided element and inserts it into the CanvasFrame.\n    * Returns an AnonymousContent instance that can be used to manipulate the\n    * inserted element.\n    */\n   [ChromeOnly, NewObject, Throws]\n   AnonymousContent insertAnonymousContent(Element aElement);\n\n   /**\n    * Removes the element inserted into the CanvasFrame given an AnonymousContent\n    * instance.\n    */\n   [ChromeOnly, Throws]\n   void removeAnonymousContent(AnonymousContent aContent);\n };\nUsing this API, it is possible for chrome-privileged JS to insert arbitrary DOM elements on top of the content page.\nTechnically, the DOM element is inserted into the CanvasFrame of the document. The CanvasFrame is part of the rendered frame tree and the DOM element is part of the native anonymous elements of the CanvasFrame.\nConsider the following simple example:\n let el = document.createElement(\"div\");\n el.textContent = \"My test element\";\n let insertedEl = document.insertAnonymousContent(el);\n\nIn this example, the test DIV will be inserted in the page, and will be displayed on top of everything else, in a way that doesn't impact the current layout.\nThe AnonymousContent API\nIn the previous example, the returned insertedEl object isn't a DOM node, and it certainly is not el. It is a new object, whose type is AnonymousContent (see the WebIDL here).\nBecause of the way content is inserted into the page, it isn't wanted to give consumers a direct reference to the inserted DOM node. This is why document.insertAnonymousContent(el) actually clones el and returns a new object whose API lets consumers make changes to the inserted element in a way that never gives back a reference to the inserted DOM node.\nCanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper\nIn order to help with the API described in the previous section, the CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper class was introduced.\nIts goal is to provide a simple way for highlighters to insert their content into the page and modify it dynamically later. One of its goal is also to re-insert the highlighters' content on page navigation. Indeed, the frame tree is destroyed when the page is navigated away from since it represents the document element. One thing to note is that highlighter content insertion is asynchronous and CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper users must call and wait for its initialize method to resolve.\nUsing this helper is quite simple:\nlet helper = new CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper(targetActor, this.buildMarkup.bind(this));\nawait helper.initialize();\n\nIt only requires a targetActor, which highlighters get when they are instantiated, and a callback function that will be used to create and insert the content the first time the highlighter is shown, and every time there's a page navigation.\nThe returned object provides the following API:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngetTextContentForElement(id)\nGet the textContent of an element given its ID.\n\n\nsetTextContentForElement(id, text)\nSet the textContent of an element given its ID.\n\n\nsetAttributeForElement(id, name, value)\nSet an attribute value of an element given its ID.\n\n\ngetAttributeForElement(id, name)\nGet an attribute value of an element given its ID.\n\n\nremoveAttributeForElement(id, name)\nRemove an attribute of an element given its ID.\n\n\ncontent\nThis property returns the wrapped AnonymousContent object.\n\n\ndestroy()\nDestroy the helper instance.\n\n\n\nCreating a new highlighter class\nA good way to get started is by taking a look at existing highlighters here.\nHere is some boilerplate code for a new highlighter class:\n function MyNewHighlighter(targetActor) {\n   this.doc = targetActor.window.document;\n   this.markup = new CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper(targetActor, this._buildMarkup.bind(this));\n   this.markup.initialize();\n }\n\n MyNewHighlighter.prototype = {\n   destroy: function() {\n     this.doc = null;\n     this.markup.destroy();\n   },\n\n   _buildMarkup: function() {\n     let container = this.markup.anonymousContentDocument.createElement(\"div\");\n     container.innerHTML = '';\n     return container;\n   },\n\n   show: function(node, options) {\n     this.markup.removeAttributeForElement(\"new-highlighted-el\", \"style\");\n   },\n\n   hide: function() {\n     this.markup.setAttributeForElement(\"new-highlighted-el\", \"style\", \"display:none;\");\n   }\n };\n\nIn most situations, the container returned by _buildMarkup will be absolutely positioned, and will need to contain elements with IDs, so that these can then later be moved, resized, hidden or shown in show and hide using the AnonymousContent API.\nThe AutoRefreshHighlighter parent class\nIt is worth mentioning this class as it may be a useful parent class to inherit a new highlighter from in some situations.\nIf the new highlighter's job is to highlight an element in the DOM, then it most likely should inherit from AutoRefreshHighlighter.\nThe AutoRefreshHighlighter class updates itself in a loop, checking if the currently highlighted node's geometry has changed since the last iteration. This is useful to make sure the highlighter follows the highlighted node around, in case the layout around it changes, or in case it is an animated node.\nSub classes must implement the following methods:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_show()\nCalled when the highlighter should be shown.\n\n\n_update()\nCalled while the highlighter is shown and the geometry of the current node changes.\n\n\n_hide()\nCalled when the highlighter should be hidden.\n\n\n\nSub classes will have access to the following properties:\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nthis.currentNode\nThe node to be shown.\n\n\nthis.currentQuads\nAll of the node's box model region quads.\n\n\nthis.win\nThe current window\n\n\n\n"},"tools/memory-panel.html":{"url":"tools/memory-panel.html","title":"Memory","keywords":"","body":"Memory Tool Architecture\nThe memory tool is built of three main elements:\n\nThe live heap graph exists in memory, and is managed by the C++ allocator and\ngarbage collector. In order to get access to the structure of this graph, a\nspecialized interface is created to represent its state. The JS::ubi::Node\nis the basis for this representation. This interface can be created from the\nlive heap graph, or a serialized, offline snapshot from a previous moment in\ntime. Our various heap analyses (census, dominator trees, shortest paths,\netc) run on top of JS::ubi::Node graphs. The ubi in the name stands for\n\"ubiquitous\" and provides a namespace for memory analyses in C++ code.\n\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker runs in a worker thread, performing analyses on\nsnapshots and translating the results into something the frontend can render\nsimply and quickly. The HeapAnalysesClient is used to communicate between\nthe worker and the main thread.\n\nFinally, the last element is the frontend that renders data received from the\nHeapAnalysesClient to the DOM and translates user input into requests for\nnew data with the HeapAnalysesClient.\n\n\nUnlike other tools (such as the JavaScript debugger), the memory tool makes very\nlittle use of the Remote DevTools Server and the actors that reside in it. Use\nof the MemoryActor is limited to toggling\nallocation stack recording on and off, and transferring heap snapshots from the\ndebuggee (which is on the server) to the HeapAnalysesWorker (which is on the\nclient). A nice benefit that naturally emerges, is that supporting \"legacy\"\nservers (eg, using Firefox Developer Edition as a client to remote debug a\nrelease Firefox for Android server) is a no-op. As we add new analyses, we can\nrun them on snapshots taken on old servers no problem. The only requirement is\nthat changes to the snapshot format itself remain backwards compatible.\nJS::ubi::Node\nJS::ubi::Node is a lightweight serializable interface that can represent the\ncurrent state of the heap graph. For a deeper dive into the particulars of how\nit works, it is very well documented in the js/public/UbiNode.h\nA \"heap snapshot\" is a representation of the heap graph at some particular past\ninstance in time.\nA \"heap analysis\" is an algorithm that runs on a JS::ubi::Node heap graph.\nGenerally, analyses can run on either the live heap graph or a deserialized\nsnapshot. Example analyses include \"census\", which aggregates and counts nodes\ninto various user-specified buckets; \"dominator trees\", which compute the\ndominates relation\nand retained size for all nodes in the heap graph; and \"shortest paths\" which\nfinds the shortest paths from the GC roots to some subset of nodes.\nSaving Heap Snapshots\nSaving a heap snapshot has a few requirements:\n\nThe binary format must remain backwards compatible and future extensible.\n\nThe live heap graph must not mutate while we are in the process of\nserializing it.\n\nThe act of saving a heap snapshot should impose as little memory overhead as\npossible. If we are taking a snapshot to debug frequent out-of-memory errors,\nwe don't want to trigger an OOM ourselves!\n\n\nTo solve (1), we use the protobuf\nmessage format. The message definitions themselves are in\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CoreDump.proto. We always use optional fields\nso we can change our mind about what fields are required sometime in the future.\nDeserialization checks the semantic integrity of deserialized protobuf messages.\nFor (2), we rely on SpiderMonkey's GC rooting hazard static analysis and the\nAutoCheckCannotGC dynamic analysis to ensure that neither JS nor GC runs and\nmodifies objects or moves them from one address in memory to another. There is\nno equivalent suppression and static analysis technique for the\ncycle collector,\nso care must be taken not to invoke methods that could start cycle collection or\nmutate the heap graph from the cycle collector's perspective. At the time of\nwriting, we don't yet support saving the cycle collector's portion of the heap\ngraph in snapshots, but that work is deemed Very Important and Very High\nPriority.\nFinally, (3) imposes upon us that we do not build the serialized heap snapshot\nbinary blob in memory, but instead stream it out to disk while generating it.\nOnce all of that is accounted for, saving snapshots becomes pretty straight\nforward. We traverse the live heap graph with JS::ubi::Node and\nJS::ubi::BreadthFirst, create a protobuf message for each node and each node's\nedges, and write these messages to disk before continuing the traversal to the\nnext node.\nThis functionality is exposed to chrome JavaScript as the\nChromeUtils.saveHeapSnapshot function. See dom/webidl/ChromeUtils.webidl for\nAPI documentation.\nReading Heap Snapshots\nReading heap snapshots has less restrictions than saving heap snapshots. The\nprotobuf messages that make up the core dump are deserialized one by one, stored\nas a set of DeserializedNodes and a set of DeserializedEdges, and the result\nis a HeapSnapshot instance.\nThe DeserializedNode and DeserializedEdge classes implement the\nJS::ubi::Node interface. Analyses running on offline heap snapshots rather\nthan the live heap graph operate on these classes (unknowingly, of course).\nFor more details, see the\nmozilla::devtools::HeapSnapshot\nand\nmozilla::devtools::Deserialized{Node,Edge}\nclasses.\nHeap Analyses\nHeap analyses operate on JS::ubi::Node graphs without knowledge of whether\nthat graph is backed by the live heap graph or an offline heap snapshot. They\nmust make sure never to allocate GC things or modify the live heap graph.\nIn general, analyses are implemented in their own js/public/Ubi{AnalysisName}.h\nheader (eg js/public/UbiCensus.h), and are exposed to chrome JavaScript code\nvia a method on the HeapSnapshot webidl\ninterface.\nFor each analysis we expose to chrome JavaScript on the HeapSnapshot webidl\ninterface, there is a small amount of glue code in Gecko. The\nmozilla::devtools::HeapSnapshot\nC++ class implements the webidl interface. The analyses methods (eg\nComputeDominatorTree) take the deserialized nodes and edges from the heap\nsnapshot, create JS::ubi::Nodes from them, call the analyses from\njs/public/Ubi*.h, and wrap the results in something that can be represented in\nJavaScript.\nFor API documentation on running specific analyses, see the\nHeapSnapshot webidl interface.\nTesting JS::ubi::Node, Snapshots, and Analyses\nThe majority of the tests reside within devtools/shared/heapsnapshot/tests/**.\nFor reading and saving heap snapshots, most tests are gtests. The gtests can be\nrun with the mach gtest DevTools.* command. The rest are integration sanity\ntests to make sure we can read and save snapshots in various environments, such\nas xpcshell or workers. These can be run with the usual mach test $PATH\ncommands.\nThere are also JS::ubi::Node related unit tests in\njs/src/jit-test/tests/heap-analysis/*, js/src/jit-test/tests/debug/Memory-*,\nand js/src/jsapi-tests/testUbiNode.cpp. See\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Running_Automated_JavaScript_Tests#Running_jit-tests\nfor running the JIT tests.\nHeapAnalysesWorker\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker orchestrates running specific analyses on snapshots and\ntransforming the results into something that can simply and quickly be rendered\nby the frontend. The analyses can take some time to run (sometimes on the order\nof seconds), so doing them in a worker thread allows the interface to stay\nresponsive. The HeapAnalysisClient provides the main thread's interface to the\nworker.\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker doesn't actually do much itself; mostly just shuffling\ndata and transforming it from one representation to another or calling C++\nutility functions exposed by webidl that do those things. Most of these are\nimplemented as traversals of the resulting census or dominator trees.\nSee the following files for details on the various data transformations and\nshuffling that the HeapAnalysesWorker delegates to.\n\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CensusUtils.js\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CensusTreeNode.js\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/DominatorTreeNode.js\n\nTesting the HeapAnalysesWorker and HeapAnalysesClient\nTests for the HeapAnalysesWorker and HeapAnalysesClient reside in\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/tests/** and can be run with the usual mach test\n$PATH command.\nFrontend\nThe frontend of the memory tool is built with React and Redux.\nReact has thorough documentation.\nRedux has thorough documentation.\nWe have React components in devtools/client/memory/components/*.\nWe have Redux reducers in devtools/client/memory/reducers/*.\nWe have Redux actions and action-creating tasks in\ndevtools/client/memory/actions/*.\nReact components should be pure functions from their props to the rendered\n(virtual) DOM. Redux reducers should also be observably pure.\nImpurity within the frontend is confined to the tasks that are creating and\ndispatching actions. All communication with the outside world (such as the\nHeapAnalysesWorker, the Remote DevTools Server, or the file system) is\nrestricted to within these tasks.\nSnapshots State\nOn the JavaScript side, the snapshots represent a reference to the underlying\nheap dump and the various analyses. The following diagram represents a finite\nstate machine describing the snapshot states. Any of these states may go to the\nERROR state, from which they can never leave.\nSAVING ‚Üí SAVED ‚Üí READING ‚Üí READ\n                  ‚Üó\n         IMPORTING\nEach of the report types (census, diffing, tree maps, dominators) have their own states as well, and are documented at devtools/client/memory/constants.js.\nThese report states are updated as the various filtering and selecting options\nare updated in the UI.\nTesting the Frontend\nUnit tests for React components are in devtools/client/memory/test/chrome/*.\nUnit tests for actions, reducers, and state changes are in\ndevtools/client/memory/test/xpcshell/*.\nHolistic integration tests for the frontend and the whole memory tool are in\ndevtools/client/memory/test/browser/*.\nAll tests can be run with the usual mach test $PATH command.\n"},"tools/debugger-panel.html":{"url":"tools/debugger-panel.html","title":"Debugger","keywords":"","body":"You can find the debugger documentation on the debugger.html GitHub repository.\n"},"tools/responsive-design-mode.html":{"url":"tools/responsive-design-mode.html","title":"Responsive Design Mode","keywords":"","body":"Responsive Design Mode Architecture\nContext\nYou have a single browser tab that has visited several pages, and now has a\nhistory that looks like, in oldest to newest order:\n\nhttps://newsblur.com\nhttps://mozilla.org (‚Üê current page)\nhttps://convolv.es\n\nOpening RDM During Current Firefox Session\nWhen opening RDM, the browser tab's history must preserved.

The Mozilla Developer SVG guidelines can be found here.\nExplanation of Pixel Grid\nSince so many of our SVGs appear so small, designing them on the pixel grid will help them not appear fuzzy when they're sized down to 16x16 pixels. There is program-specific documentation in both the Illustrator and Sketch sections.\nPanel Icon Requirements\nThe devtools panel icons do a couple of things in a specific way; following these guidelines will help stick your patch:\n\nInline fill colors. Devtools panel icons all use fill=\"#0b0b0b\" in the  tag.\nInline opacities. Devtools panel icons also inline opacities on their relevant path.\n\nIllustrator\nFor Illustrator you'll want the following document settings:\n\nDocument settings: Units: pixels, Advanced > check Align New Objects to Pixel Grid\nTransform Panel: for existing artwork not on pixel grid, select shape and then within Transform > Advanced > check Align to Pixel Grid\n\nYou can get a more detailed breakdown with images here.\nYou can download a sample Illustrator file here.\nTips for Object Creation\nWhen you're designing your icons in a graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator, there are a lot of things you can do that will bring down the size of the file and make your SVGs easier for the developers to work with. Here are some of them:\n\nExpand paths: Instead of having multiple shapes overlapping each other, expand shapes using the pathfinder.\n\nSimplify paths (Object > Path > Simplify)\nExpand objects so that strokes become objects. This has the added benefit of keeping the stroke size intact as the SVG is resized.\n\n\nSketch\nSketch vector work is a little different but the fundamentals (keeping your SVG small, expanding all paths) is the same. Here's what we've found helps to build clean icons:\n\nBuild your icon at 16x16 with the Pixel Grid turned on. You can turn the pixel grid on at View > Canvas > Show Pixels\n\nMake sure that all x/y coordinates are full pixels for lines/rectangles. Sub-pixels = not on pixel grid.\n\n\nExpand all your paths so strokes expand properly as the SVG gets resized. You can do this at Layer > Paths > Vectorize Stroke.\n\nAlign anything that isn't boxy to the pixel grid with item selected then Layer > Round to Nearest Pixel Edge.\n\n\n"},"frontend/react.html":{"url":"frontend/react.html","title":"React","keywords":"","body":"We use React to write our user\ninterfaces. In here you can find an explanation of why we chose React\nand a short primer on it. Additionally, we list best practices that\nall devtools code should adhere to when writing React.\nQuick Intro\nThis is a very quick introduction on how to use React, but does not\nexplain in-depth the concepts behind it. If you want more in-depth\narticles, I recommend the following links:\n\nhttp://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html - the official tutorial\nhttps://github.com/petehunt/react-howto - how to learn React\nhttp://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome - long read but explains the concepts in depth\n\nReact embraces components as a way of thinking about UIs. Components\nare the center of everything: they are composable like functions,\ntestable like JSON data, and provide lifecycle APIs for more complex\nscenarios.\nA component can represent anything from a single item in a list to a\ncomplete virtualized grid that is made up of sub-components. They can\nbe used to abstract out \"behaviors\" instead of UI elements (think of a\nSelectable component). React's API makes it easy to break up your UI\ninto whatever abstractions you need.\nThe core idea of a component is simple: it's something that takes\nproperties and returns a DOM-like structure.\nfunction Item({ name, iconURL }) {\n  return div({ className: \"item\" },\n             img({ className: \"icon\", href: iconURL }),\n             name);\n}\n\nThe div and span functions refer to React.DOM.div and\nReact.DOM.span. React provides constructors for all DOM elements on\nReact.DOM. These conform to the standard API for creating elements:\nthe first argument takes properties, and the rest are children.\nYou can see component composition kick in when using Item:\nconst Item = React.createFactory(require('./Item'));\n\nfunction List({ items }) {\n  return div({ className: \"list\" },\n             items.map(item => Item({ name: item.name, icon: item.iconURL)));\n}\n\nYou can use custom components exactly the same way you use native\nones! The only difference is we wrapped it in a factory when importing\ninstead of using the React.DOM functions. Factories are just a way of\nturning a component into a convenient function. Without factories, you\nneed to do do React.createElement(Item, { ... }), which is exactly\nthe same as Item({ ... }) if using a factory.\nRendering and Updating Components\nNow that we have some components, how do we render them? You use\nReact.render for that:\nlet items = [{ name: \"Dubois\", iconURL: \"dubois.png\" },\n             { name: \"Ivy\", iconURL: \"ivy.png\" }];\n\nReact.render(List({ items: items }),\n             document.querySelector(\"#mount\"));\n\nThis renders a List component, given items, to a DOM node with an\nid of mount. Typically you have a top-level App component that is\nthe root of everything, and you would render it like so.\nWhat about updating? First, let's talk about data. The above\ncomponents take data from above and render out DOM structure. If any\nuser events were involved, the components would call callbacks passed\nas props, so events walk back up the hierarchy. The conceptual model\nis data goes down, and events come up.\nYou usually want to change data in response to events, and rerender\nthe UI with the new data. What does that look like? There are two\nplaces where React will rerender components:\n1. Any additional React.render calls. Once a component is mounted,\nyou can call React.render again to the same place and React will see\nthat it's already mounted and perform an update instead of a full\nrender. For example, this code adds an item in response to an event\nand updates the UI, and will perform optimal incremental updates:\nfunction addItem(item) {\n  render([...items, item]);\n}\n\nfunction render(items) {\n  React.render(List({ items: items,\n                      onAddItem: addItem }),\n               document.querySelector(\"#mount\"));\n}\n\nrender(items);\n\n2. Changing component local state. This is much more common. React\nallows components to have local state, and whenever the state is\nchanged with the setState API it will rerender that specific\ncomponent. If you use component local state, you need to create a\ncomponent with createClass:\nconst App = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return { items: [] };\n  },\n\n  handleAddItem: function(item) {\n    const items = [...this.props.items, item];\n    this.setState({ items: items });\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return List({ items: this.state.items,\n                  onAddItem: this.handleAddItem });\n  }\n});\n\nIf you are using something like Redux to manage state this is handled\nautomatically for you with the library you use to bind Redux with\nReact. See more in Redux.\nDOM Diffing\nWhat does it mean when React \"updates\" a component, and how does it\nknow which DOM to change? React achieves this with a technique called\nDOM diffing. This alleviates the need for the programmer to worry\nabout how updates are actually applied to the DOM, and components can\nrender DOM structure declaratively in response to data. In the above\nexamples, when adding an item, React knows to only add a new DOM node\ninstead of recreating the whole list each time.\nDOM diffing is possible because our components return what's called\n\"virtual DOM\": a lightweight JSON structure that React can use to diff\nagainst previous versions, and generate minimal changes to the real DOM.\nThis also makes it really east to test components with a real DOM:\njust make sure the virtual DOM has what it should.\nNext\nRead the React Guidelines next to learn how to\nwrite React code specifically for the devtools.\n"},"frontend/react-guidelines.html":{"url":"frontend/react-guidelines.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Guidelines for Writing React\nThese are soft rules for writing react devtools code. Try to stick to\nthese for consistency, and if you disagree, file a bug to change these\ndocs and we can talk about it.\nPlease also read the coding\n standards\nfor react and redux code. The guidelines here are more general\npatterns not specific to code style.\nWhy no JSX?\nYou probably already noticed we don't use JSX. The answer isn't\ncomplicated: we don't build our JS code, and we write directly for our\nJS engine, SpiderMonkey. It already supports much of ES6, but it does\nnot support JSX (which is not a standard).\nThis may change if we ever adopt a build step. Even so, the author is\nnot convinced that JSX helps enough to warrant all the syntax. It is\nclearer sometimes, but it can be noisy switching between JSX and JS a\nlot.\nIt's not as bad as you may think! If you are used to JSX it may be an\nadjustment, but you won't miss it too much.\nOne component per file\nTry to only put one component in a file. This helps avoid large files\nfull of components, but it's also technically required for how we wrap\ncomponents with factories. See the next rule.\nIt also makes it easier to write tests because you might not export\nsome components, so tests can't access them.\nYou can include small helper components in the same file if you really\nwant to, but note that they won't be directly tested and you will have\nto use React.createElement or immediately wrap them in factories to\nuse them.\nExport the component directly and create factory on import\nModules are the way components interact. Ideally every component lives\nin a separate file and they require whatever they need. This allows\ntests to access all components and use module boundaries to wrap\ncomponents.\nFor example, we don't use JSX, so we need to create factories for\ncomponents to use them as functions. A simple way to do this is on\nimport:\nconst Thing1 = React.createFactory(require('./thing1'));\nconst Thing2 = React.createFactory(require('./thing2'));\n\nIt adds a little noise, but then you can do Thing1({ ... }) instead\nof React.createElement(Thing1, { ... }). Definitely worth it.\nAdditionally, make sure to export the component class directly:\nconst Thing1 = React.createClass({ ... });\nmodule.exports = Thing1;\n\nDo not export { Thing1 } or anything like that. This is required for\nthe factory wrapping as well as hot reloading.\nMore to Come\nThis is just a start. We will add more to this document.\n"},"frontend/redux.html":{"url":"frontend/redux.html","title":"Redux","keywords":"","body":"We use Redux to manage application\nstate. The docs do a good job explaining the\nconcepts, so go read them.\nQuick Intro\nJust like the React introduction, this is a quick\nintroduction to redux, focusing on how it fits into React and why we\nchose it.\nOne of the core problems that React does not address is managing\nstate. In the React intro, we talked about data flowing down and\nevents flowing up. Conceptually this is nice, but you quickly run into\nawkward situations in large apps.\nLet's look at an example. Say you have a page with a tabbed interface.\nHere, Tab1 is managing a list of items, so naturally it uses local\nstate. Tab2 renders different stuff.\nconst Tab1 = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return { items: [] };\n  },\n\n  handleAddItem: function(item) {\n    this.setState({ items: [...this.state.items, item]});\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    /* ... Renders the items and button to add new item ... */\n  }\n});\n\nconst Tab2 = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    /* ... Renders other data ... */\n  }\n});\n\n// Assume `Tab1` and `Tab2` are wrapped with a factory when importing\nconst Tabs = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return div(\n      { className: 'tabs' },\n      // ... Render the tab buttons ...\n      Tab1(),\n      Tab2()\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nWhat happens when Tab2 needs the list of items though? This scenario\ncomes up all time: components that aren't directly related need access\nto the same state. A small change would be to move the items state\nup to the Tabs component, and pass it down to both Tab1 and Tab2.\nBut now Tabs has to implement the handleAddItem method to add an\nitem because it's managing that state. This quickly gets ugly as the\nend result is the root component ends up with a ton of state and\nmethods to manage it: a god\ncomponent is born.\nAdditionally, how do we know what data each tab needs? We end up\npassing all the state down because we don't know. This is not a\nmodular solution: one object managing the state and every component\nreceiving the entire state is like using tons of global variables.\nEvolution of Flux\nFacebook addressed this with the\nflux architecture, which takes the\nstate out of the components and into a \"store\". Redux is the latest\nevolution of this idea and solves a lot of problems previous flux\nlibraries had (read it's documentation for more info).\nBecause the state exists outside the component tree, any component can\nread from it. Additionally, state is updated with\nactions that any\ncomponent can fire. We have guidelines for where\nto read/write state, but it completely solves the problem described\nabove. Both Tab1 and Tab2 would be listening for changes in the\nitem state, and Tab1 would fire actions to change it.\nWith redux, state is managed modularly with\nreducers but tied\ntogether into a single object. This means a single JS object\nrepresents most* of your state. It may sound crazy at first, but think\nof it as an object with references to many pieces of state; that's all\nit is.\nThis makes it very easy to test, debug, and generally think about. You\ncan log your entire state to the console and inspect it. You can even\ndump in old states and \"replay\" to see how the UI changed over time.\nI said \"most*\" because it's perfectly fine to use both component local\nstate and redux. Be aware that any debugging tools will not see local\nstate at all though. It should only be used for transient state; we'll\ntalk more about that in the guidelines.\nImmutability\nAnother important concept is immutability. In large apps, mutating\nstate makes it very hard to track what changed when. It's very easy to\nrun into situations where something changes out from under you, and\nthe UI is rendered with invalid data.\nRedux enforces the state to be updated immutably. That means you\nalways return new state. It doesn't mean you do a deep copy of the\nstate each time: when you need to change some part of the tree you\nonly need to create new objects to replace the ones your changing (and\nwalk up to the root to create a new root). Unchanged subtrees will\nreference the same objects.\nThis removes a whole class of errors, almost like Rust removing a\nwhole class of memory errors by enforcing ownership.\nOrder of Execution\nOne of best things about React is that rendering is synchronous. That\nmeans when you render a component, given some data, it will fully\nrender in the same tick. If you want the UI to change over time, you\nhave to change the data and rerender, instead of arbitrary UI\nmutations.\nThe reason this is desired is because if you build the UI around\npromises or event emitters, updating the UI becomes very brittle\nbecause anything can happen at any time. The state might be updated in\nthe middle of rendering it, maybe because you resolved a few promises\nwhich made your rendering code run a few ticks later.\nRedux embraces the synchronous execution semantics as well. What this\nmeans is that everything happens in a very controlled way. When\nupdating state through an action, all reducers are run and a new state\nis synchronously generated. At that point, the new state is handed off\nto React and synchronously rendered.\nUpdating and rendering happen in two phases, so the UI will always\nrepresent consistent state. The state can never be in the middle of\nupdating when rendering.\nWhat about asynchronous work? That's where\nmiddleware come\nin. At this point you should probably go study our code, but\nmiddleware allows you to dispatch special actions that indicate\nasynchronous work. The middleware will catch these actions and do\nsomething async, dispatching \"raw\" actions along the way (it's common\nto emit a START, DONE, and ERROR action).\nUltimately there are 3 \"phases\" or level of abstraction: the async\nlayer talks to the network and may dispatch actions, actions are\nsynchronously pumped through reducers to generate state, and state is\nrendered with react.\nNext\nRead the Redux Guidelines next to learn how to\nwrite React code specifically for the devtools.\n"},"frontend/redux-guidelines.html":{"url":"frontend/redux-guidelines.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Getting data from the store\nTo get data from the store, use connect().\nWhen using connect, you'll break up your component into two parts:\n\nThe part that displays the data (presentational component)\n // todos.js\n const Todos = React.createClass({\n   propTypes: {\n     todos: PropTypes.array.isRequired\n   }\n\n   render: function() {...}\n })\n\n module.exports = Todos;\n\nThe part that gets the data from the store (container component)\n // todos-container.js\n const Todos = require(\"path/to/todos\");\n\n function mapStateToProps(state) {\n   return {\n     todos: state.todos\n   };\n }\n\n module.exports = connect(mapStateToProps)(Todos);\n\n\nconnect() generates the container component. It wraps around the presentational component that was passed in (e.g. Todos).\nThe mapStateToProps is often called a selector. That's because it selects data from the state object. When the container component is rendering, the the selector will be called. It will pick out the data that the presentational component is going to need. Redux will take this object and pass it in to the presentational component as props.\nWith this setup, a presentational component is easy to share across different apps. It doesn't have any dependencies on the app, or any hardcoded expectations about how to get data. It just gets props that are passed to it and renders them.\nFor more advanced use cases, you can pass additional parameters into the selector and connect() functions.

This will help us take better, informed decisions when prioritising our work.\nAdding metrics to a tool\nThe process to add metrics to a tool roughly consists in:\n\nAdding the probe to Firefox\nUsing Histograms.json probes in DevTools code\nUsing Scalars.yaml probes in DevTools code\nUsing Events.yaml probes in DevTools code for analysis in Amplitude.\nGetting approval from the data team\n\n1. Adding the probe to Firefox\nThe first step involves creating entries for the probe in one of the files that contain declarations for all data that Firefox might report to Mozilla.\nThese files are:\n\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Histograms.json\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Scalars.yaml\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml\n\nScalars allow collection of simple values, like counts, booleans and strings and are to be used whenever possible instead of histograms.\nHistograms allow collection of multiple different values, but aggregate them into a number of buckets. Each bucket has a value range and a count of how many values we recorded.\nEvents allow collection of a number of properties keyed to a category, method, object and value. Event telemetry helps us tell a story about how a user is interacting with the browser.\nBoth scalars & histograms allow recording by keys. This allows for more flexible, two-level data collection.\nThe different file formats\nThe data team chose YAML for Scalars.yaml and Events.yaml because it is easy to write and provides a number of features not available in JSON including comments, extensible data types, relational anchors, strings without quotation marks, and mapping types preserving key order.\nWhile we previously used JSON for similar purposes in histograms.json, we have used YAML here because it allows for comments and is generally easier to write.\nThe data team are considering moving the histograms over to YAML format at some point.\nIf it's the first time you add one of these, it's advised to follow the style of existing entries.\nNew data types have been added over the years, so it's quite feasible that some of our probes are not the most suitable nowadays.\nThere's more information about types (and telemetry in general) on this page and this other page.\nAnd of course, in case of doubt, ask!\nAdding probes to Histograms.json\nOur entries are prefixed with DEVTOOLS_. For example:\n  \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_OPENED_COUNT\": {\n    \"alert_emails\": [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\"],\n    \"expires_in_version\": \"never\",\n    \"kind\": \"count\",\n    \"bug_numbers\": [1343501],\n    \"description\": \"Number of times the DevTools DOM Inspector has been opened.\",\n    \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n  },\n  \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS\": {\n    \"alert_emails\": [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\"],\n    \"expires_in_version\": \"never\",\n    \"kind\": \"exponential\",\n    \"bug_numbers\": [1343501],\n    \"high\": 10000000,\n    \"n_buckets\": 100,\n    \"description\": \"How long has the DOM inspector been active (seconds)\"\n  },\n\nThere are different types of probes you can use. These are specified by the kind field. Normally we use count for counting how many times the tools are opened, and exponential for how many times a panel is active.\nAdding probes to Scalars.yaml\nOur entries are prefixed with devtools.. For example:\ndevtools.toolbar.eyedropper:\n  opened:\n    bug_numbers:\n      - 1247985\n      - 1352115\n    description: Number of times the DevTools Eyedropper has been opened via the inspector toolbar.\n    expires: never\n    kind: uint\n    notification_emails:\n      - dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'main'\n\ndevtools.copy.unique.css.selector:\n  opened:\n    bug_numbers:\n      - 1323700\n      - 1352115\n    description: Number of times the DevTools copy unique CSS selector has been used.\n    expires: \"57\"\n    kind: uint\n    notification_emails:\n      - dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'main'\n\nAdding probes to Events.yaml\nOur entries are prefixed with devtools.. For example:\ndevtools.main:\n  open:\n    objects: [\"tools\"]\n    bug_numbers: [1416024]\n    notification_emails: [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\", \"hkirschner@mozilla.com\"]\n    record_in_processes: [\"main\"]\n    description: User opens devtools toolbox.\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    expiry_version: never\n    extra_keys:\n      entrypoint: How was the toolbox opened? CommandLine, ContextMenu, HamburgerMenu, KeyShortcut, SessionRestore or SystemMenu\n      first_panel: The name of the first panel opened.\n      host: \"Toolbox host (positioning): bottom, side, window or other.\"\n      splitconsole: Indicates whether the split console was open.\n      width: Toolbox width (px).\n\n2. Using Histograms.json probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Histograms.json file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nFirst, you need to give it an id in devtools/client/shared/telemetry.js. Similarly to the Histograms.json case, you'll want to follow the style of existing entries. For example:\ndom: {\n  histogram: \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_OPENED_COUNT\",\n  timerHistogram: \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS\"\n},\n\n... would correspond to the probes we declared in the previous section.\nThen, include that module on each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\n... or closing:\nthis._telemetry.toolClosed(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\nNote that mytoolname is the id we declared in the telemetry.js module.\n3. Using Scalars.yaml probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Scalars.yaml file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nFirst, you need to give it an id in devtools/client/shared/telemetry.js. You will want to follow the style of existing lowercase histogram entries. For example:\ntoolbareyedropper: {\n  scalar: \"devtools.toolbar.eyedropper.opened\", // Note that the scalar is lowercase\n},\ncopyuniquecssselector: {\n  scalar: \"devtools.copy.unique.css.selector.opened\",\n},\n\n... would correspond to the probes we declared in the previous section.\nThen, include that module on each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\nNotes:\n\nmytoolname is the id we declared in the Scalars.yaml module.\nBecause we are not logging tool's time opened in Scalars.yaml we don't care\nabout toolClosed. Of course, if there was an accompanying timerHistogram\nfield defined in telemetry.js and histograms.json then toolClosed should\nalso be added.\n\n4. Using Events.yaml probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Events.yaml file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nIt is crucial to understand that event telemetry have a string identifier which is constructed from the category, method, object (name) and value on which the event occurred. This key points to an \"extra\" object that contains further information about the event (we will give examples later in this section).\nBecause these \"extra\" objects can be from completely independent code paths we\ncan send events and leave them in a pending state until all of the expected extra properties have been received.\nFirst, include the telemetry module in each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\n// Event telemetry is disabled by default so enable it for your category.\nthis._telemetry.setEventRecordingEnabled(true);\n\n// If you already have all the properties for the event you can send the\n// telemetry event using:\n// this._telemetry.recordEvent(method, object, value, extra) e.g.\nthis._telemetry.recordEvent(\"open\", \"tools\", null, {\n  \"entrypoint\": \"ContextMenu\",\n  \"first_panel\": \"Inspector\",\n  \"host\": \"bottom\",\n  \"splitconsole\": false,\n  \"width\": 1024,\n  \"session_id\": this.toolbox.sessionId\n});\n\n// If your \"extra\" properties are in different code paths you will need to\n// create a \"pending event.\" These events contain a list of expected properties\n// that can be populated before or after creating the pending event.\n\n// Use the category, method, object, value combinations above to add a\n// property... we do this before creating the pending event simply to\n// demonstrate that properties can be sent before the pending event is created.\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"entrypoint\", \"ContextMenu\");\n\n// In this example `\"open\", \"tools\", null` make up the\n// signature of the event and needs to be sent with all properties.\n\n// Create the pending event using\n// this._telemetry.preparePendingEvent(this, method, object, value,\n// expectedPropertyNames) e.g.\nthis._telemetry.preparePendingEvent(this, \"open\", \"tools\", null,\n  [\"entrypoint\", \"first_panel\", \"host\", \"splitconsole\", \"width\", \"session_id\"]\n);\n\n// Use the category, method, object, value combinations above to add each\n// property.\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"first_panel\", \"inspector\");\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"host\", \"bottom\");\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"splitconsole\", false);\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"width\", 1024);\n\n// You can also add properties in batches using e.g.:\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperties(this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, {\n  \"first_panel\": \"inspector\",\n  \"host\": \"bottom\",\n  \"splitconsole\": false,\n  \"width\": 1024\n});\n\nNotes:\n\nmytoolname is the id we declared in the Scalars.yaml module.\nBecause we are not logging tool's time opened in Scalars.yaml we don't care\nabout toolClosed. Of course, if there was an accompanying timerHistogram\nfield defined in telemetry.js and histograms.json then toolClosed should\nalso be added.\n\nNote on top level panels\nThe code for the tabs uses their ids to automatically report telemetry when you switch between panels, so you don't need to explicitly call toolOpened and toolClosed on top level panels.\nYou will still need to call those functions on subpanels, or tools such as about:debugging which are not opened as tabs.\nTesting\nThe telemetry module will print warnings to stdout if there are missing ids. It is strongly advisable to ensure this is working correctly, as the module will attribute usage for undeclared ids to a generic custom bucket. This is not good for accurate results!\nTo see these warnings, you need to have the browser.dom.window.dump.enabled browser preference set to true in about:config (and restart the browser).\nThen, try doing things that trigger telemetry calls (e.g. opening a tool). Imagine we had a typo when reporting the tool was opened:\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened('mytoolnmae', sessionId, this);\n                                  ^^^^ typo, should be *mytoolname*\n\nWould report an error to stdout:\nWarning: An attempt was made to write to the mytoolnmae histogram, which is not defined in Histograms.json\n\nSo watch out for errors.\nTesting Event Telemetry\nThis is best shown via an example:\n/* Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain.\n * http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ */\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst { Toolbox } = require(\"devtools/client/framework/toolbox\");\nconst { TelemetryTestUtils } = ChromeUtils.import(\"resource://testing-common/TelemetryTestUtils.jsm\");\n\nconst URL = \"data:text/html;charset=utf8,browser_toolbox_telemetry_close.js\";\nconst { RIGHT, BOTTOM } = Toolbox.HostType;\nconst DATA = [\n  {\n    category: \"devtools.main\",\n    method: \"close\",\n    object: \"tools\",\n    value: null,\n    extra: {\n      host: \"right\",\n      width: w => w > 0,\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    category: \"devtools.main\",\n    method: \"close\",\n    object: \"tools\",\n    value: null,\n    extra: {\n      host: \"bottom\",\n      width: w => w > 0,\n    }\n  }\n];\n\nadd_task(async function() {\n  // Let's reset the counts.\n  Services.telemetry.clearEvents();\n\n  // Ensure no events have been logged\n  TelemetryTestUtils.assertNumberOfEvents(0);\n\n  await openAndCloseToolbox(\"webconsole\", SIDE);\n  await openAndCloseToolbox(\"webconsole\", BOTTOM);\n\n  checkResults();\n});\n\nasync function openAndCloseToolbox(toolId, host) {\n  const tab = await addTab(URL);\n  const target = await TargetFactory.forTab(tab);\n  const toolbox = await gDevTools.showToolbox(target, toolId);\n\n  await toolbox.switchHost(host);\n  await toolbox.destroy();\n}\n\nfunction checkResults() {\n  TelemetryTestUtils.assertEvents(DATA, {category: \"devtools.main\", method: \"close\", object: \"tools\"});\n}\n\nCompile it\nYou need to do a full Firefox build if you have edited either Histograms.json or Events.yaml, as they are processed at build time, and various checks will be run on them to guarantee they are valid.\n./mach build\n\nIf you use mach build faster or artifact builds, the checks will not be performed, and your try builds will fail (\"bust\") when the checks are run there.\nSave yourself some time and run the checks locally.\nNOTE: Changes to Scalars.yaml are processed when doing an artifact build.\n4. Getting approval from the data team\nThis is required before the changes make their way into mozilla-central.\nTo get approval, attach your patch to the bug in Bugzilla, and set two flags:\n\na review? flag for a data steward.\na needinfo? flag to hkirschner (our product manager, so he vouches that we're using the data)\n\nBe sure to explain very clearly what is the new probe for. E.g. \"We're seeking approval for tracking opens of a new panel for debugging Web API ABCD\" is much better than just asking for feedback without background info.\nThis review shouldn't take too long: if there's something wrong, they should tell you what to fix. If you see no signs of activity after a few days, you can ask in #developers.\nNote that this review is in addition to normal colleague reviews.\nClick here for more details.\nAccessing existing data\nLocal data\nGo to about:telemetry to see stats relating to your local instance.\nGlobal data\nData aggregated from large groups of Firefox users is available at telemetry.mozilla.org.\nReports are written with SQL. For example, here's one comparing usage of some DevTools panels.\nIf you want to get better understanding of how people are using the tools, you are encouraged to explore this data set by writing your own reports.\nThe easiest way to get started is to fork an existing report and modify it to get used to the syntax, as SQL for massive data tables is very different from SQL for a humble blog engine, and you'll find some new operators that might look unfamiliar.\nIt's also recommended to take small steps and run the queries often to detect errors before they're too complicated to solve, particularly if you're not experienced with this (yet).\nSlow queries will be interrupted by the system, so don't worry about \"fetching too much data\" or \"using too many resources\". There's built-in protection to avoid your code eating up the Telemetry database.\nFunnily, if you're based in Europe, you might be in luck, as the website tends to be more responsive during European working hours than it is at Pacific working hours, as seemingly there's less people in Europe interacting with it.\n"},"frontend/csp.html":{"url":"frontend/csp.html","title":"Content Security Policy","keywords":"","body":"The DevTools toolbox is loaded in an iframe pointing to about:devtools-toolbox. This iframe has a Content Security Policy (CSP) applied, which will mitigate potential attacks. However this may limit the resources that can be loaded in the toolbox documenth.\nCurrent DevTools CSP\nThe current policy for about:devtools-toolbox is:\ndefault-src chrome: resource:; img-src chrome: resource: data:; object-src 'none'\nThis means:\n\nchrome:// and resource:// are allowed for any resource\nchrome:// and resource:// and data:// are allowed for images\n\nFor more information about which resources and requests are in scope of the CSP, you can read the default-src documentation on MDN.\nScope of the DevTools CSP\nThis content security policy only applies to the toolbox document for now. If you are working within the document of a panel or if you are working on the server, those limitations should not apply.\nNote that even when working in the document of a panel, we are sometimes interacting with the toolbox document, for instance to show tooltips. So typically any resource created for a tooltip will be subject to the CSP limitations.\nRecognizing CSP issues\nOpen the Browser Toolbox, if you see errors such as\nJavaScript Error: \"Content Security Policy: The page‚Äôs settings blocked the loading of a resource [...]\"\nit means you are trying to load a resource with a forbidden scheme.\nFixing CSP issues\nIf your implementation hits a CSP issue, the first suggestion is to try to use a supported scheme. If this is not an option, check if you can perform your request or load your resource outside of the toolbox document. For instance if the resource you are loading is related to the debugged target, the request can (and probably should) be made from an actor in the DevTools server and then forwarded from the server to the client. Requests made by the server will not be impacted by the CSP.\nIf it seems like the only solution is to update the CSP, get in touch with security peers in order to discuss about your use case. You can file a bug in Core/DOM: security.\nFixing CSP issues in tests\nIf the issue comes from test code, it should be possible to update the test to use a supported scheme. A typical issue might be trying to load an iframe inside of the toolbox with a data-uri. Instead, you can create an HTML support file and load it from either a chrome:// or a resource:// URL.\nIn general once a support file is added you can access it via:\n\nhttps://example.com/browser/[path_to_file]\nor chrome://mochitests/content/browser/[path_to_file]\n\nFor instance devtools/client/aboutdebugging/test/browser/resources/service-workers/controlled-sw.html is accessed in tests via http://example.com/browser/devtools/client/aboutdebugging/test/browser/resources/service-workers/controlled-sw.html.\nIf you absolutely have to use an unsupported scheme, you can turn off CSPs for the test only. To do so, you need to temporarily update two preferences:\nawait pushPref(\"security.csp.enable\", false);\nawait pushPref(\"dom.security.skip_about_page_has_csp_assert\", true);\nThe pushPref helper will ensure the preferences come back to their initial value at the end of the test.\n"},"backend/protocol.html":{"url":"backend/protocol.html","title":"Remote Debugging Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Remote Debugging Protocol\nThe Mozilla debugging protocol allows a debugger to connect to a browser, discover what sorts of things are present to debug or inspect, select JavaScript threads to watch, and observe and modify their execution. The protocol provides a unified view of JavaScript, DOM nodes, CSS rules, and the other technologies used in client-side web applications. The protocol ought to be sufficiently general to be extended for use with other sorts of clients (profilers, say) and servers (mail readers; random XULrunner applications).\nAll communication between debugger (client) and browser (server) is in the form of JSON objects. This makes the protocol directly readable by humans, capable of graceful evolution, and easy to implement using stock libraries. In particular, it should be easy to create mock implementations for testing and experimentation.\nThe protocol operates at the JavaScript level, not at the C++ or machine level, and assumes that the JavaScript implementation itself is healthy and responsive. The JavaScript program being executed may well have gone wrong, but the JavaScript implementation's internal state must not be corrupt. Bugs in the implementation may cause the debugger to fail; bugs in the interpreted program must not.\nGeneral Conventions\nActors\nAn actor is something on the server that can exchange JSON packets with the client. Every packet from the client specifies the actor to which it is directed, and every packet from the server indicates which actor sent it.\nEach server has a root actor, with which the client first interacts. The root actor can explain what sort of thing the server represents (browser; mail reader; etc.), and enumerate things available to debug: tabs, chrome, and so on. Each of these, in turn, is represented by an actor to which requests can be addressed. Both artifacts of the program being debugged, like JavaScript objects and stack frames, and artifacts of the debugging machinery, like breakpoints and watchpoints, are actors with whom packets can be exchanged.\nFor example, a debugger might connect to a browser, ask the root actor to list the browser's tabs, and present this list to the developer. If the developer chooses some tabs to debug, then the debugger can send attach requests to the actors representing those tabs, to begin debugging.\nActor names are JSON strings, containing no spaces or colons. The name of the root actor is \"root\".\nTo allow the server to reuse actor names and the resources they require, actors have limited lifetimes. All actors in a server form a tree, whose root is the root actor. Closing communications with an actor automatically closes communications with its descendants. For example, the actors representing a thread's stack frames are children of the actor representing the thread itself, so that when a debugger detaches from a thread, which closes the thread's actor, the frames' actors are automatically closed. This arrangement allows the protocol to mention actors liberally, without making the client responsible for explicitly closing every actor that has ever been mentioned.\nWhen we say that some actor A is a child of some actor B, we mean that A is a direct child of B, not a grandchild, great-grandchild, or the like. Similarly, parent means \"direct parent\". We use the terms ancestor and descendent to refer to those looser relationships.\nThe root actor has no parent, and lives as long as the underlying connection to the client does; when that connection is closed, all actors are closed.\nNote that the actor hierarchy does not, in general, correspond to any particular hierarchy appearing in the debuggee. For example, although web workers are arranged in a hierarchy, the actors representing web worker threads are all children of the root actor: one might want to detach from a parent worker while continuing to debug one of its children, so it doesn't make sense to close communications with a child worker simply because one has closed communications with its parent.\n(We are stealing the \"actor\" terminology from Mozilla's IPDL, to mean, roughly, \"things participating in the protocol\". However, IPDL does much more with the idea than we do: it treats both client and server as collections of actors, and uses that detail to statically verify properties of the protocol. In contrast, the debugging protocol simply wants a consistent way to indicate the entities to which packets are directed.)\nPackets\nThe protocol is carried by a reliable, bi-directional byte stream; data sent in both directions consists of JSON objects, called packets. A packet is a top-level JSON object, not contained inside any other value.\nEvery packet sent from the client has the form:\n{ \"to\":actor, \"type\":type, ... }\nwhere actor is the name of the actor to whom the packet is directed and type is a string specifying what sort of packet it is. Additional properties may be present, depending on type.\nEvery packet sent from the server has the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, ... }\nwhere actor is the name of the actor that sent it. The packet may have additional properties, depending on the situation.\nIf a packet is directed to an actor that no longer exists, the server sends a packet to the client of the following form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"noSuchActor\" }\nwhere actor is the name of the non-existent actor. (It is strange to receive messages from actors that do not exist, but the client evidently believes that actor exists, and this reply allows the client to pair up the error report with the source of the problem.)\nClients should silently ignore packet properties they do not recognize. We expect that, as the protocol evolves, we will specify new properties that can appear in existing packets, and experimental implementations will do the same.\nCommon Patterns of Actor Communication\nEach type of actor specifies which packets it can receive, which it might send, and when it can do each. Although in principle these interaction rules could be complex, in practice most actors follow one of two simple patterns:\n\nRequest/Reply: Each packet sent to the actor (\"request\") elicits a single packet in response (\"reply\").\nRequest/Reply/Notify: Like Request/Reply, but the actor may send packets that are not in response to any specific request (\"notification\"), perhaps announcing events that occur spontaneously in the debuggee.\n\nThese patterns are described in more detail below.\nSome actors require more complicated rules. For example, the set of packets accepted by a Thread-like actor depends on which one of four states it occupies. The actor may spontaneously transition from one state to another, and not all state transitions produce notification packets. Actors like this require careful specification.\nThe Request/Reply Pattern\nIn this specification, if we call a packet a request, then it is a packet sent by the client, which always elicits a single packet from the actor in return, the reply. These terms indicate a simple pattern of communication: the actor processes packets in the order they are received, and the client can trust that the i'th reply corresponds to the i'th request.\nAn error reply packet from a request/reply actor constitutes a reply.\nNote that it is correct for a client to send several requests to a request/reply actor without waiting for a reply to each request before sending the next; requests can be pipelined. However, as the pending requests consume memory, the client should ensure that only a bounded number of requests are outstanding at any one time.\nThe Request/Reply/Notify Pattern\nSome actors follow the request/reply pattern, but may also send the client notification packets, not in reply to any particular request. For example, if the client sends the root actor a [\"listTabs\"](#listing-browser-tabs) request, then the root actor sends a reply. However, since the client has now expressed an interest in the list of open tabs, the root actor may subsequently send the client a \"tabListChanged\" notification packet, indicating that the client should re-fetch the list of tabs if it is interested in the latest state.\nThere should be a small upper bound on the number of notification packets any actor may send between packets received from the client, to ensure that the actor does not flood the client. In the example above, the root actor sends at most one \"tabListChanged\" notification after each \"listTabs\" request.\nError Packets\nAny actor can reply to a packet it is unable to process with an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":name, \"message\":message }\nwhere name is a JSON string naming what went wrong, and message is an English error message. Error names are specified by the protocol; the client can use the name to identify which error condition arose. The message may vary from implementation to implementation, and should only be displayed to the user as a last resort, as the server lacks enough information about the user interface context to provide appropriate messages.\nIf an actor receives a packet whose type it does not recognize, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"unrecognizedPacketType\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers understand what went wrong: what kind of actor actor is; the packet received; and so on.\nIf an actor receives a packet which is missing needed parameters (say, an \"autocomplete\" packet with no \"text\" parameter), it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"missingParameter\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers fix the problem.\nIf an actor receives a packet with a parameter whose value is inappropriate for the operation, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"badParameterType\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers fix the problem. (Some packets' descriptions specify more specific errors for particular circumstances.)\nGrips\nA grip is a JSON value that refers to a specific JavaScript value in the debuggee. Grips appear anywhere an arbitrary value from the debuggee needs to be conveyed to the client: stack frames, object property lists, lexical environments, paused packets, and so on.\nFor mutable values like objects and arrays, grips do not merely convey the value's current state to the client. They also act as references to the original value, by including an actor to which the client can send messages to modify the value in the debuggee.\nA grip has one of the following forms:\nvalue\nwhere value is a string, a number, or a boolean value. For these types of values, the grip is simply the JSON form of the value.\n{ \"type\":\"null\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript null value. (The protocol does not represent JavaScript null simply by the JSON null, for the convenience of clients implemented in JavaScript: this representation allows such clients to use typeof(grip) == \"object\" to decide whether the grip is simple or not.)\n{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript undefined value. (undefined has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"Infinity\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript Infinity value. (Infinity has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"-Infinity\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript -Infinity value. (-Infinity has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"NaN\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript NaN value. (NaN has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"-0\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript -0 value. (-0 stringifies to JSON as 0.)\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":className, \"actor\":actor }\nThis represents a JavaScript object whose class is className. (Arrays and functions are treated as objects for the sake of forming grips.) Actor can be consulted for the object's contents, as explained below.\nIf the class is \"Function\", the grip may have additional properties:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\":actor,\n  \"name\":name, \"displayName\":displayName,\n  \"userDisplayName\":userDisplayName,\n  \"url\":url, \"line\":line, \"column\":column }\nThese additional properties are:\nName\nThe function's name (as given in the source code, following the function keyword), as a string. If the function is anonymous, the name property is omitted.\ndisplayName\nA name the system has inferred for the function (say, \"Foo.method\"). If the function has a given name (appearing in the grip as the \"name\" property), or if the system was unable to infer a suitable name for it, the displayName property is omitted.\nuserDisplayName\nIf the function object has a \"displayName\" value property whose value is a string, this is that property's value. (Many JavaScript development tools consult such properties, to give developers a way to provide their own meaningful names for functions.)\nurl\nThe URL of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\nline\nThe line number of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\ncolumn\nThe column number of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\n{ \"type\":\"longString\", \"initial\":initial, \"length\":length, \"actor\":actor }\nThis represents a very long string, where \"very long\" is defined at the server's discretion. Initial is some initial portion of the string, length is the string's full length, and actor can be consulted for the rest of the string, as explained below.\nFor example, the following table shows some JavaScript expressions and the grips that would represent them in the protocol:\n\n\n\nJavaScript Expression\nGrip\n\n\n\n\n42\n42\n\n\ntrue\ntrue\n\n\n\"nasu\"\n\"nasu\"\n\n\n(void 0)\n{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\n\n\n({x:1})\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\":\"24\" }\n\n\n\"Arms and the man I sing, who, [much, much more text]\"\n{ \"type\":\"longString\", \"initial\":\"Arms and the man I sing\", \"length\":606647, \"actor\":\"25\" }\n\n\n\nGarbage collection will never free objects visible to the client via the protocol. Thus, actors representing JavaScript objects are effectively garbage collection roots.\nObjects\nWhile a thread is paused, the client can send requests to the actors appearing in object grips to examine the objects they represent in more detail.\nProperty Descriptors\nProtocol requests that describe objects' properties to the client often use descriptors, JSON values modeled after ECMAScript 5's property descriptors, to describe individual properties.\nA descriptor has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":, ... }\nwhere enumerable and configurable are boolean values indicating whether the property is enumerable and configurable, and additional properties are present depending on what sort of property it is.\nA descriptor for a data property has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":,\n  \"value\":, \"writeable\": }\nwhere value is a grip on the property's value, and writeable is a boolean value indicating whether the property is writeable.\nA descriptor for an accessor property has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":,\n  \"get\":, \"set\": }\nwhere getter and setter are grips on the property's getter and setter functions. These may be { \"type\":\"undefined\" } if the property lacks the given accessor function.\nA safe getter value descriptor provides a value that an inherited accessor returned when applied to an instance. (See Finding An Object's Prototype And Properties for an explanation of why and when such descriptors are used.) Such a descriptor has the form:\n{ \"getterValue\": , \"getterPrototypeLevel\": ,\n  \"enumerable\":, \"writable\": }\nwhere value is a grip on the value the getter returned, level is the number of steps up the object's prototype chain one must take to find the object on which the getter appears as an own property. If the getter appears directly on the object, level is zero. The writable property is true if the inherited accessor has a setter, and false otherwise.\nFor example, if the JavaScript program being debugged evaluates the expression:\n({x:10, y:\"kaiju\", get a() { return 42; }})\nthen a grip on this value would have the form:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\": }\nand sending a \"prototypeAndProperties\" request to actor would produce the following reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\": },\n  \"ownProperties\":{ \"x\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true, \"writeable\":true, \"value\":10 },\n                    \"y\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true, \"writeable\":true, \"value\":\"kaiju\" },\n                    \"a\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true,\n                          \"get\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                          \"set\":{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\n                        }\n                   }\n}\nSending a \"prototypeAndProperties\" request to an object actor referring to a DOM mouse event might produce the following reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"MouseEvent\", \"actor\": },\n  \"ownProperties\":{ }\n  \"safeGetterValues\":{ \"screenX\": { \"getterValue\": 1000, \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"screenY\": { \"getterValue\": 1000, \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"clientX\": { \"getterValue\": 800,  \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"clientY\": { \"getterValue\": 800,  \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       ...\n                     }\n}\nFinding An Object's Prototype And Properties\nTo examine an object's prototype and properties, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"prototypeAndProperties\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":, \"ownProperties\": }\nwhere prototype is a grip on the object's prototype (possibly { \"type\":\"null\" }), and ownProperties has the form:\n{ name:, ... }\nwith a name: pair for each of the object's own properties.\nThe web makes extensive use of inherited accessor properties; for example, the clientX and clientY> properties of a mouse click event are actually accessor properties which the event object inherits from its prototype chain. It can be very valuable to display such properties' values directly on the object (taking care to distinguish them from true \"own\" properties), if the server can determine that the getters can be called without side effects.\nTo this end, when possible, the server may provide safe getter value descriptors for an object, as described in Property Descriptors above, reporting the values that getter functions found on the object's prototype chain return when applied to that object. If the server chooses to provide any, the reply includes a \"safeGetterValues\" property of the form:\n{ name:, ... }\nwith a name: pair for each safe getter the object inherits from its prototype chain, or that appears directly on the object. Each descriptor here is a safe getter value descriptor.\nTODO: What about objects with many properties?\nFinding an Object's Prototype\nTo find an object's prototype, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"prototype\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\": }\nwhere prototype is a grip on the object's prototype (possibly { \"type\":\"null\" }).\nListing an Object's Own Properties' Names\nTo list an object's own properties' names, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"ownPropertyNames\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"ownPropertyNames\":[ , ... ] }\nwhere each name is a string naming an own property of the object.\nFinding Descriptors For Single Properties\nTo obtain a descriptor for a particular property of an object, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"property\", \"name\": }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"descriptor\": }\nwhere descriptor is a descriptor for the own property of the object named name, or null if the object has no such own property.\nA property descriptor has the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":, ... }\nwhere configurable and enumerable are boolean values. Configurable is true if the property can be deleted or have its attributes changed. Enumerable is true if the property will be enumerated by a for-in enumeration.\nDescriptors for value properties have the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":,\n    \"writable\":, \"value\": }\nwhere writable is true if the property's value can be written to; value is a grip on the property's value; and configurable and enumerable are as described above.\nDescriptors for accessor properties have the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":,\n    \"get\":, \"set\": }\nwhere get and set are grips on the property's getter and setter functions; either or both are omitted if the property lacks the given accessor function. Configurable and enumerable are as described above.\nTODO: assign to value property\nTODO: special stuff for arrays\nTODO: special stuff for functions\nTODO: find function's source position\nTODO: get function's named arguments, in order\nTODO: descriptors for Harmony proxies\nFunctions\nIf an object's class as given in the grip is \"Function\", then the grip's actor responds to the messages given here.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"parameterNames\" }\nThis requests the names of the parameters of the function represented by functionGripActor. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"parameterNames\":[ , ... ] }\nwhere each parameter is the name of a formal parameter to the function as a string. If the function takes destructuring arguments, then parameter is a structure of JSON array and object forms matching the form of the destructuring arguments.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"scope\" }\nReturn the lexical environment over which the function has closed. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"scope\": }\nwhere environment is a lexical environment. Note that the server only returns environments of functions in a context being debugged; if the function's global scope is not the browsing context to which we are attached, the function grip actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notDebuggee\", \"message\": }\nwhere message is text explaining the problem.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"decompile\", \"pretty\": }\nReturn JavaScript source code for a function equivalent to the one represented by functionGripActor. If the optional pretty parameter is present and pretty is true, then produce indented source code with line breaks. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"decompiledCode\": }\nwhere code is a string.\nIf functionGripActor's referent is not a function, or is a function proxy, the actor responds to these requests with an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"objectNotFunction\", message: }\nwhere message is a string containing any additional information that would be helpful to debugger developers.\nLong Strings\nThe client can find the full contents of a long string by sending a request to the long string grip actor of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"substring\", \"start\":, \"end\": }\nwhere start and end are integers. This requests the substring starting at the start'th character, and ending before the end'th character. The actor replies as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"substring\": }\nwhere string is the requested portion of the string the actor represents. Values for start less than zero are treated as zero; values greater than the length of the string are treated as the length of the string. Values for end are treated similarly. If end is less than start, the two values are swapped. (This is meant to be the same behavior as JavaScript's String.prototype.substring.)\nAs with any other actor, the client may only send messages to a long string grip actor while it is alive: for pause-lifetime grips, until the debuggee is resumed; or for thread-lifetime grips, until the thread is detached from or exits. However, unlike object grip actors, the client may communicate with a long string grip actor at any time the actor is alive, regardless of whether the debuggee is paused. (Since strings are immutable values in JavaScript, the responses from a long string grip actor cannot depend on the actions of the debuggee.)\nGrip Lifetimes\nMost grips are pause-lifetime grips: they last only while the JavaScript thread is paused, and become invalid as soon as the debugger allows the thread to resume execution. (The actors in pause-lifetime grips are children of an actor that is closed when the thread resumes, or is detached from.) This arrangement allows the protocol to use grips freely in responses without requiring the client to remember and close them all.\nHowever, in some cases the client may wish to retain a reference to an object or long string while the debuggee runs. For example, a panel displaying objects selected by the user must update its view of the objects each time the debuggee pauses. To carry this out, the client can promote a pause-lifetime grip to a thread-lifetime grip, which lasts until the thread is detached from or exits. Actors in thread-lifetime grips are children of the thread actor. When the client no longer needs a thread-lifetime grip, it can explicitly release it.\nBoth pause-lifetime and thread-lifetime grips are garbage collection roots.\nTo promote a pause-lifetime grip to a thread-lifetime grip, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"threadGrip\" }\nwhere gripActor is the actor from the existing pause-lifetime grip. The grip actor will reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"threadGrip\": }\nwhere threadGrip is a new grip on the same object, but whose actor is parented by the thread actor, not the pause actor.\nThe client can release a thread-lifetime grip by sending the grip actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"release\" }\nThe grip actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nThis closes the grip actor. The \"release\" packet may only be sent to thread-lifetime grip actors; if a pause-lifetime grip actor receives a \"release\" packet, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notReleasable\", \"message\": }\nwhere each gripActor is the name of a child of thread that should be freed. The thread actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nRegardless of the lifetime of a grip, the client may only send messages to object grip actors while the thread to which they belong is paused; the client's interaction with mutable values cannot take place concurrently with the thread.\nCompletion Values\nSome packets describe the way a stack frame's execution completed using a completion value, which takes one of the following forms:\n{ \"return\": }\nThis indicates that the frame completed normally, returning the value given by grip.\n{ \"throw\": }\nThis indicates that the frame threw an exception; grip is the exception value thrown.\n{ \"terminated\":true }\nThis indicates that the frame's execution was terminated, as by a \"slow script\" dialog box or running out of memory.\nSource Locations\nMany packets refer to particular locations in source code: breakpoint requests specify where the breakpoint should be set; stack frames show the current point of execution; and so on.\nDescriptions of source code locations (written as location in packet descriptions) can take one of the following forms:\n{ \"url\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code loaded from url. Line and column numbers start with 1. If column or line are omitted, they default to 1.\n{ \"eval\":, \"id\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code passed to the call to eval at location. To distinguish the different texts passed to eval, each is assigned a unique integer, id.\n{ \"function\":, \"id\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code passed to the call to the Function constructor at location. To distinguish the different texts passed to the Function constructor, each is assigned a unique integer, id.\nAs indicated, locations can be nested. A location like this one:\n{ \"eval\":{ \"eval\":{ \"url\":\"file:///home/example/sample.js\", \"line\":20 }\n           \"id\":300, \"line\":30 }\n  \"id\":400, \"line\":40 }\nrefers to line 40 of the code passed to the call to eval occurring on line 30 of the code passed to the call to eval on line 20 of file:///home/example/sample.js.\nThe Root Actor\nWhen the connection to the server is opened, the root actor opens the conversation with the following packet:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"applicationType\":, \"traits\":, ...}\nThe root actor's name is always \"root\". appType is a string indicating what sort of program the server represents. There may be more properties present, depending on appType.\ntraits is an object describing protocol variants this server supports that are not convenient for the client to detect otherwise. The property names present indicate what traits the server has; the properties' values depend on their names. If traits would have no properties, the \"traits\" property of the packet may be omitted altogether. This version of the protocol defines no traits, so if the \"traits\" property is present at all, its value must be an object with no properties, {}.\nFor web browsers, the introductory packet should have the following form:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"applicationType\":\"browser\", \"traits\": }\nListing Browser Tabs\nTo get a list of the tabs currently present in a browser, a client sends the root actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":\"root\", \"type\":\"listTabs\" }\nThe root actor replies:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"tabs\":[, ...], \"selected\": }\nwhere each tab describes a single open tab, and selected is the index in the array of tabs of the currently selected tab. This form may have other properties describing other global actors; for one example, see Chrome Debugging.\nEach tab has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"title\":, \"url\": }\nwhere targetActor is the name of an actor representing the tab, and title and URL are the title and URL of the web page currently visible in that tab. This form may have other properties describing other tab-specific actors.\nTo attach to a targetActor, a client sends a message of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"attach\" }\nThe target actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"threadActor\": }\nwhere tabThreadActor is the name of a thread-like actor representing the tab's current content. If the user navigates the tab, tabThreadActor switches to the new content; we do not create a separate thread-like actor each page the tab visits.\nIf the user closes the tab before the client attaches to it, targetActor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"exited\" }\nWhen the client is no longer interested in interacting with the tab, the client can request:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"detach\" }\nThe targetActor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nIf the client was not already attached to targetActor, targetActor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\" }\nWhile the client is attached, targetActor sends notifications to the client whenever the user navigates the tab to a new page. When navigation begins, targetActor sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabNavigated\", \"state\":\"start\",\n  \"url\": }\nThis indicates that the tab has begun navigating to newURL; JavaScript execution in the tab's prior page is suspended. When navigation is complete, targetActor sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabNavigated\", \"state\":\"stop\",\n  \"url\":, \"title\": }\nwhere newURL and newTitle are the URL and title of the page the tab is now showing. The tabThreadActor given in the response to the original \"attach\" packet is now debugging the new page's code.\nIf the user closes a tab to which the client is attached, its targetActor sends a notification packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabDetached\" }\nThe client is now detached from the tab.\nChrome Debugging\nIf the server supports debugging chrome code, the root actor's reply to a \"listTabs\" request includes a property named \"chromeDebugger\", whose value is the name of a thread-like actor to which the client can attach to debug chrome code.\nInteracting with Thread-Like Actors\nActors representing independent threads of JavaScript execution, like browsing contexts and web workers, are collectively known as \"threads\". Interactions with actors representing threads follow a more complicated communication pattern.\nA thread is always in one of the following states:\n\nDetached: the thread is running freely, and not presently interacting with the debugger. Detached threads run, encounter errors, and exit without exchanging any sort of messages with the debugger. A debugger can attach to a thread, putting it in the Paused state. Or, a detached thread may exit on its own, entering the Exited state.\n\nRunning: the thread is running under the debugger's observation, executing JavaScript code or possibly blocked waiting for input. It will report exceptions, breakpoint hits, watchpoint hits, and other interesting events to the client, and enter the Paused state. The debugger can also interrupt a running thread; this elicits a response and puts the thread in the Paused state. A running thread may also exit, entering the Exited state.\n\nPaused: the thread has reported a pause to the client and is awaiting further instructions. In this state, a thread can accept requests and send replies. If the client asks the thread to continue or step, it returns to the Running state. If the client detaches from the thread, it returns to the Detached state.\n\nExited: the thread has ceased execution, and will disappear. The resources of the underlying thread may have been freed; this state merely indicates that the actor's name is not yet available for reuse. When the actor receives a \"release\" packet, the name may be reused.\n\n\n\nThese interactions are meant to have certain properties:\n\nAt no point may either client or server send an unbounded number of packets without receiving a packet from its counterpart. This avoids deadlock without requiring either side to buffer an arbitrary number of packets per actor.\nIn states where a transition can be initiated by either the debugger or the thread, it is always clear to the debugger which state the thread actually entered, and for what reason.For example, if the debugger interrupts a running thread, it cannot be sure whether the thread stopped because of the interruption, paused of its own accord (to report a watchpoint hit, say), or exited. However, the next packet the debugger receives will either be \"paused\", or \"exited\", resolving the ambiguity.Similarly, when the debugger attaches to a thread, it cannot be sure whether it has succeeded in attaching to the thread, or whether the thread exited before the \"attach\" packet arrived. However, in either case the debugger can expect a disambiguating response: if the attach succeeded, it receives an \"attached\" packet; and in the second case, it receives an \"exit\" packet.To support this property, the thread ignores certain debugger packets in some states (the \"interrupt\" packet in the Paused and Exited states, for example). These cases all handle situations where the ignored packet was preempted by some thread action.\n\nNote that the rules here apply to the client's interactions with each thread actor separately. A client may send an \"interrupt\" to one thread actor while awaiting a reply to a request sent to a different thread actor.\nTODO: What about user selecting nodes in displayed content? Should those be eventy things the client can receive in the \"paused\" state? What does that mean for the \"request\"/\"reply\" pattern?\nAttaching To a Thread\nTo attach to a thread, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"attach\" }\nHere, thread is the actor representing the thread, perhaps a browsing context from a \"listContexts\" reply. This packet causes the thread to pause its execution, if it does not exit of its own accord first. The thread responds in one of two ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"why\":{ \"type\":\"attached\" }, ... }\nThe thread is now in the Paused state, because the client has attached to it. The actor name thread remains valid until the client detaches from the thread or acknowledges a thread exit. This is an ordinary \"paused\" packet, whose form and additional properties are as described in Thread Pauses, below.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited on its own before receiving the \"attach\" packet. The thread is now in the Exited state. The client should follow by sending a \"release\" packet; see Exiting Threads, below.\nIf the client sends an \"attach\" packet to a thread that is not in the Detached or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nDetaching From a Thread\nTo detach from a thread, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"detach\" }\nThe thread responds in one of three ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nThis indicates that the client has detached from the thread. The thread is now in the Detached state: it can run freely, and no longer reports events to the client. Communications with thread are closed, and the actor name is available for reuse. If the thread had been in the Paused state, the pause actor is closed (because the pause actor is a child of thread).\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", ... }\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nThis series of packets indicates that the thread paused of its own accord (for the reason given by the additional properties of the \"paused\" packet), and only then received the \"detach\" packet. As above, this indicates that the thread is in the Detached state, the just-created pause actor is closed, and the actor name is available for reuse.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited on its own before receiving the \"detach\" packet. The client should follow by sending a \"release\" packet; see Exiting Threads, below.\nDetaching from a thread causes all breakpoints, watchpoints, and other debugging-related state to be forgotten.\nIf the client sends a \"detach\" packet to a thread that is not in the Running, Paused, or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nRunning Threads\nOnce the client has attached to a thread, it is in the Running state. In this state, four things can happen:\n\nThe thread can hit a breakpoint or watchpoint, or encounter some other condition of interest to the client.\nThe thread can exit.\nThe client can detach from the thread.\nThe client can interrupt the running thread.\n\nNote that a client action can occur simultaneously with a thread action. The protocol is designed to avoid ambiguities when both client and thread act simultaneously.\nThread Pauses\nIf the thread pauses to report an interesting event to the client, it sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"actor\":, \"why\":,\n  \"currentFrame\":, \"poppedFrames\":[...] }\nThis indicates that the thread has entered the Paused state, and explains where and why.\nPauseActor is a \"pause actor\", representing this specific pause of the thread; it lives until the thread next leaves the Paused state. The pause actor parents actors referring to values and other entities uncovered during this pause; when the thread resumes, those actors are automatically closed. This relieves the client from the responsibility to explicitly close every actor mentioned during the pause.\nSince actors in value grips are parented by the pause actor, this means that those grips become invalid when the thread resumes, or is detached from; it is not possible to take a grip from one pause and use it in the next. To create a grip that remains valid between pauses, see Grip Lifetimes.\nThe currentFrame value describes the top frame on the JavaScript stack; see Listing Stack Frames, below.\nThe \"poppedFrames\" property is an array of frame actor names, listing the actors for all frames that were live as of the last pause, but have since been popped. If no frames have been popped, or if this is the first pause for this thread, then this property's value is the empty array.\nThe reason value describes why the thread paused. It has one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"attached\" }\nThe thread paused because the client attached to it.\n{ \"type\":\"interrupted\" }\nThe thread stopped because it received an \"interrupt\" packet from the client.\n{ \"type\":\"resumeLimit\" }\nThe client resumed the thread with a \"resume\" packet that included a resumeLimit property, and the thread paused because the given limit was met. Execution remains in the frame the thread was resumed in, and that frame is not about to be popped.\n{ \"type\":\"resumeLimit\", \"frameFinished\": }\nThe client resumed the thread with a \"resume\" packet that included a resumeLimit property, and the thread paused because the frame is about to be popped. Completion is a completion value describing how the frame's execution ended. The frame being popped is still the top frame on the stack, but subsequent \"resume\" operations will run in the calling frame.\n{ \"type\":\"debuggerStatement\" }\nThe thread stopped because it executed a JavaScript \"debugger\" statement.\n{ \"type\":\"breakpoint\", \"actors\":[...] }\nThe thread stopped at the breakpoints represented by the given actors.\n{ \"type\":\"watchpoint\", \"actors\":[...] }\nThe thread stopped at the watchpoints represented by the given actors.\nTODO: This should provide more details about the watchpoint in the packet, instead of incurring another round-trip before we can display anything helpful.\n{ \"type\":\"clientEvaluated\", \"frameFinished\": }\nThe expression given in the client's prior clientEvaluate command has completed execution; completion is a completion value describing how it completed. The frame created for the clientEvaluate resumption has been popped from the stack. See Evaluating Source-Language Expressions for details.\nResuming a Thread\nIf a thread is in the Paused state, the client can resume it by sending a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\" }\nThis puts the thread in the Running state. The thread will pause again for breakpoint hits, watchpoint hits, throw watches, frame pop watches, and other standing pause requests.\nTo step a thread's execution, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"resumeLimit\": }\nLimit must have one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"next\" }\nThe thread should pause:\n\njust before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception or returning a value; or\nwhen control in the current frame reaches a different statement than the one it is currently at.\n\nNote that execution in frames younger than the current frame never meets these conditions, so a \"next\" limit steps over calls, generator-iterator invocations, and so on.\n{ \"type\":\"step\" }\nThe thread should pause:\n\njust before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception or returning a value; or\njust after a new frame is pushed; or\nwhen control in the current frame reaches a different statement than the one it is currently at.\n\nThis is the same as \"next\", except that it steps into calls.\nTo resume the thread but have it stop when the current frame is about to be popped, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"resumeLimit\":{ \"type\":\"finish\" } }\nHere, the thread should pause just before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception, returning a value, or being terminated.\nWhen a thread pauses because a limit was reached, the \"paused\" packet's reason will have a type of \"resumeLimit\".\nA resume limit applies only to the current resumption; once the thread pauses, whether because the limit was reached or some other event occurred‚Äîa breakpoint hit, for example‚Äîthe resume limit is no longer in effect.\nIf no \"resumeLimit\" property appears in the \"resume\" packet, then the thread should run until some standing pause condition is met (a breakpoint is hit; a watchpoint triggers; or the like).\nTo force the current frame to end execution immediately, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"forceCompletion\": }\nwhere completion is a completion value indicating whether the frame should return a value, throw an exception, or be terminated. Execution resumes in the current frame's caller, in the manner appropriate for completion.\nTo request that execution pause when an exception is thrown, the client may send a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"pauseOnExceptions\": true }\nIf pauseOnExceptions has the value false or is omitted, execution will continue in the face of thrown exceptions. When a thread pauses because an exception was thrown, the \"paused\" packet's reason will have the following form:\n{ \"type\":\"exception\", \"exception\": }\nwhere exception is a grip on the exception object.\nTo request that execution pause on a DOM event, the client may send a request of the form:\nIf a \"forceCompletion\" property is present in a \"resume\" packet, along with \"resumeLimit\", or \"pauseOnExceptions\", the thread will respond with an error:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"badParameterType\", \"message\": }\nA \"resume\" packet closes the pause actor the client provided in the \"paused\" packet that began the pause.\nIf the client sends a \"resume\" packet to a thread that is not in the Paused state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nInterrupting a Thread\nIf a thread is in the Running state, the client can cause it to pause where it is by sending a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"interrupt\" }\nThe thread responds in one of two ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"why\":, ... }\nThis indicates that the thread stopped, and is now in the Paused state. If reason is { \"type\":\"interrupted\" }, then the thread paused due to the client's interrupt packet. Otherwise, the thread paused of its own accord before receiving the interrupt packet, and will ignore the interrupt packet when it receives it. In either case, this is an ordinary \"paused\" packet, whose form and additional properties are as described in Thread Pauses, above.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited before receiving the client's interrupt packet, and is now in the Exited state. See Exiting Threads, below.\nIf the client sends an \"interrupt\" packet to a thread that is not in the Running, Paused, or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nExiting Threads\nWhen a thread in the Running state exits, it sends a packet of the following form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nAt this point, the thread can no longer be manipulated by the client, and most of the thread's resources may be freed; however, the thread actor name must remain alive, to handle stray interrupt and detach packets. To allow the last trace of the thread to be freed, the client should send a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"release\" }\nThis acknowledges the exit and allows the thread actor name, thread, to be reused for other actors.\nInspecting Paused Threads\nWhen a thread is in the Paused state, the debugger can make requests to inspect its stack, lexical environment, and values.\nOnly those packets explicitly defined to do so can cause the thread to resume execution. JavaScript features like getters, setters, and proxies, which could normally lead inspection operations like enumerating properties and examining their values to run arbitrary JavaScript code, are disabled while the thread is paused. If a given protocol request is not defined to let the thread run, but carrying out the requested operation would normally cause it to do so‚Äîsay, fetching the value of a getter property‚Äîthe actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"threadWouldRun\", \"message\":, \"cause\": }\nwhere message is text that could be displayed to users explaining why the operation could not be carried out. Cause is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\ncause value\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n\"proxy\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause a proxy handler to run.\n\n\n\"getter\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause an object property getter to run.\n\n\n\"setter\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause an object property setter to run.\n\n\n\n(Taken together, the \"threadWouldRun\" error name and the cause value should allow the debugger to present an appropriately localized error message.)\nLoading Script Sources\nTo get a snapshot of all sources currently loaded by the thread actor, the client can send the following packet:\n{ to: , type: \"sources\" }\nThe response packet has the form:\n{ from: , sources: [, , ..., ] }\nWhere each sourceForm has the following form:\n{ actor: ,\n  url: ,\n  isBlackBoxed:  }\n\nsourceActorID is the source actor's id\nsourceURL is the URL of the source represented by the source actor\nisBlackBoxed is a boolean specifying whether the source actor's 'black-boxed' flag is set. See Black Boxing Sources.\n\nEach source actor exists throughout the thread's whole lifetime.\nTo get the contents of a source, send the corresponding source actor the following packet:\n{ to: , type: \"source\" }\nAnd the source actor replies with a packet of the following form:\n{ from: , source:  }\nwhere contentsOfSource is a grip representing the string of source code: either a JSON string, or a long string grip. (See Grips for a description of long string grips.)\nBlack-Boxing Sources\nWhen debugging a web application that uses large off-the-shelf JavaScript libraries, it may help the developer focus on their own code to treat such libraries as \"black boxes\", whose internal details are omitted or simplified in the user interface. For example, the user interface could display a sub-chain of stack frames within a black-boxed library as a single element; breakpoints set in a black-boxed library could be disabled; and so on.\nEach source actor has a 'black-boxed' flag, and understands requests to set and clear the flag. When a source actor is black-boxed, the debugger does not pause when it hits breakpoints or debugger statements inside that source. If pausing on exceptions is enabled and an exception is thrown inside a black-boxed source, the debugger does not pause until the stack has unwound to a frame in a source that is not black-boxed.\nThread actors still list black-boxed source actors in \"sources\" replies; and include stack frames running black-boxed code in \"frames\" requests. However, each sourceForm includes an \"isBlackBoxed\" property, giving the client all the information it needs to implement the black-boxing behavior in the user interface.\nTo set a source actor's 'black-boxed' flag:\n{ \"to\": , \"type\": \"blackbox\" }\nThe sourceActor responds with a blank response on success:\n{ \"from\":  }\nOr an error response on failure:\n{ \"from\": , \"error\":  }\nTo clear a source actor's 'black-boxed' flag:\n{ \"to\": , \"type\": \"unblackbox\" }\nAnd once again, the sourceActor responds with a blank response on success:\n{ \"from\":  }\nOr an error response on failure:\n{ \"from\": , \"error\":  }\nListing Stack Frames\nTo inspect the thread's JavaScript stack, the client can send the following request:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"frames\", \"start\":, \"count\": }\nThe start and count properties are optional. If present, start gives the number of the youngest stack frame the reply should describe, where the youngest frame on the stack is frame number zero; if absent, start is taken to be zero. If present, count specifies the maximum number of frames the reply should describe; if absent, it is taken to be infinity. (Clients should probably avoid sending frames requests with no count, to avoid being flooded by frames from unbounded recursion.)\nThe thread replies as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"frames\":[ ...] }\nwhere each frame has the form:\n{ \"actor\": ,\n  \"depth\": ,\n  \"type\": ,\n  \"this\": ,\n  ... }\nwhere:\n\nactor is the name of an actor representing this frame;\ndepth is the number of this frame, starting with zero for the youngest frame on the stack;\ntype is a string indicating what sort of frame this is; and\nthis is a grip on the value of this for this call.\n\nThe frame may have other properties, depending on type.\nAll actors mentioned in the frame or grips appearing in the frame (actor, callee, environment, and so on) are parented by the thread actor.\nGlobal Code Frames\nA frame for global code has the form:\n{ \"actor\":,\n  \"depth\":,\n  \"type\":\"global\",\n  \"this\":,\n  \"where\":,\n  \"source\":,\n  \"environment\": }\nwhere:\n\nlocation is the source location of the current point of execution in the global code (see Source Locations);\nenvironment is a value representing the lexical environment of the current point of execution (see Lexical Environments);\nsource is a source form as described in Loading Script Sources\n\nand other properties are as above.\nFunction Call Frames\nA frame for an ordinary JavaScript function call has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"call\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\":,\n  \"callee\":, \"arguments\": }\nwhere:\n\ncallee is a grip on the function value being called;\narguments is an array of grips on the actual values passed to the function;\n\nand other properties are as above.\nIf the callee is a host function, or a function scoped to some global other than the one to which we are attached, the \"where\" and \"environment\" properties are absent.\nThe argument list may be incomplete or inaccurate, for various reasons. If the program has assigned to its formal parameters, the original values passed may have been lost, and compiler optimizations may drop some argument values.\nEval Frames\nA frame for a call to eval has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"eval\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\": }\nwhere the properties are as defined above.\nClient Evaluation Frames\nWhen the client evaluates an expression with an clientEvaluate packet, the evaluation appears on the stack as a special kind of frame, of the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"clientEvaluate\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\": }\nwhere the properties are as defined above. In this case, where will be a location inside the expression provided by the debugger.\nPopping Stack Frames\nThe client can remove frames from the stack by sending a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"pop\", \"completionValue\": }\nwhere frameActor is the actor representing the stack frame to pop, and completion is a completion value describing how the frame should appear to have finished execution. All younger stack frames are also popped. The thread remains paused. The frame actor will reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"watches\":[ ...] }\nwhere each watchActor is the name of a frame pop watch actor that has been triggered in the process of popping the given frame. If no frame pop watches are triggered, the watches property may be omitted.\nTODO: specify the error to return if the frame cannot be popped --- can host (C++) function frames be popped?\nEvaluating Source-Language Expressions\nTo evaluate a source-language expression in a thread, the client sends a specialized \"resume\" packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"clientEvaluate\", \"expression\":, \"frame\": }\nThis resumes the thread just as an ordinary \"resume\" packet does, but, rather than continuing execution where the pause took place, has the thread begin evaluation of the source-language expression given by expr, a string. The evaluation takes place in a new Client Evaluation Frame, pushed on top of thread's current stack, using the environment of frame. Frame must be a live actor for one of thread's frames, and the given frame must be one from which we can retrieve a lexical environment; that is, it must not be the frame for a call to a non-debuggee function. When evaluation of expr completes, the client will report a clientEvaluate pause containing the expression's value.\nIf evaluating expr completes abruptly, this outcome is still reported via an clientEvaluated pause, so it is not necessary for the client to take explicit steps to catch exceptions thrown by the expression.\nIf frame is not the name of an actor for a frame currently on thread's stack, the thread actor sends a reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"unknownFrame\", \"message\": }\nwhere message provides any details that would be helpful to the debugger developers. In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nIf frame is not a frame whose environment we can access, the thread actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notDebuggee\", \"message\": }\nwhere message provides further appropriate details.\nIf the client sends a \"clientEvaluate\" packet to a thread that is not in the Paused state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nTODO: evaluate with given grips bound to given identifiers\nLexical Environments\nA lexical environment (written as environment in packet descriptions) records the identifier bindings visible at a particular point in the program. An environment has one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"actor\":, \"object\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents a scope chain element whose identifier bindings reflect the properties of object (a grip). This could be the global object (window in a browser), or a DOM element (for event handler content attributes, which have the input element, form, and document on their scope chain along with the window).\nActor is the name of an actor representing this lexical environment. The requests it can answer are described below.\nParentEnvironment is a lexical environment describing the next enclosing environment; the parent property is omitted on the outermost environment.\n{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":, \"function\":,\n  \"bindings\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents the variable environment created by a call to function (a grip). Bindings describes the bindings in scope, including the function's arguments, the arguments object, and local var and function bindings; its form is described in detail below. The other properties are as described above.\n{ \"type\":\"with\", \"actor\":, \"object\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents an environment introduced by a with statement whose operand is object (a grip). The other properties are as described above.\n{ \"type\":\"block\", \"actor\":, \"bindings\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents an environment introduced by a let block, for-in statement, catch block, or the like. The properties are as described above.\nA bindings value has the form:\n{ \"arguments\":[ { name: }, ... ],\n  \"variables\":{ name:, ... } }\nEach name is the name of a bound identifier, as a string. Each descriptor is a property descriptor for the variable, presenting the variable's value as the descriptor's \"value\" property, and the variable's mutability as the descriptor's \"writable\" property. The descriptor's \"configurable\" property reflects whether the environment supports deleting and adding variables. Each descriptor's \"enumerable\" property is true.\nThe \"arguments\" list appears only in bindings for \"function\" environments. It lists the arguments in the order they appear in the function's definition. (The same name may appear several times in the list, as permitted by JavaScript; the name's last appearance is the one in scope in the function.)\nNote that language implementations may omit some environment records from a function's scope if it can determine that the function would not use them. This means that it may be impossible for a debugger to find all the variables that ought to be in scope.\nTo fully enumerate the bindings introduced by any lexical environment, the client can send a request of the following form to the environment's actor:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"bindings\" }\nThe actor will reply as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"bindings\": }\nNote that this request elicits a \"threadWouldRun\" error reply when envActor refers to an object environment whose object is a proxy.\nTo change the value of a variable bound in a particular lexical environment, the client can send a request to the environment's actor:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"assign\", \"name\":, \"value\": }\nThis changes the value of the identifier whose name is name (a string) to that represented by value (a grip). The actor will reply as follows, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nIf the named identifier is immutable, the actor will send an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"immutableBinding\", \"message\": }\nIf envActor refers to an object environment whose object is a proxy, or whose property named name has a setter function, this request elicits a \"threadWouldRun\" error reply.\nLexical Environment Examples\nFor example, if we have the following JavaScript code:\nfunction f(x) {\n  function g(y) {\n    var z = \"value of z\";\n    alert(x + y);\n  }\n}\nwe set a breakpoint on the line containing the call to alert, and then evaluate the expression:\nf(\"argument to f\")(\"argument to g\")\nthen we would hit that breakpoint, eliciting a packet like the following:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"actor\":,\n  \"why\":{ \"type\":\"breakpoint\", \"actors\":[] },\n  \"frame\":{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":1,\n            \"type\":\"call\", \"where\":{ \"url\":\"sample.js\", \"line\":3 },\n            \"environment\":{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":,\n                            \"function\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                            \"functionName\":\"g\",\n                            \"bindings\":{ arguments: [ { \"y\": { \"value\":\"argument to g\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                               \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } ] },\n                            \"parent\":{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":,\n                                       \"function\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                                       \"functionName\":\"f\",\n                                       \"bindings\": { arguments: [ { \"x\": { \"value\":\"argument to f\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                                    \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } ],\n                                                     variables: { \"z\": { \"value\":\"value of z\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                                         \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } },\n                                       \"parent\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"actor\":,\n                                                  \"object\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Global\",\n                                                             \"actor\": }\n                                                }\n                                     }\n                          },\n                       \"callee\":, \"calleeName\":\"g\",\n            \"this\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n            \"arguments\":[\"argument to g\"]\n          }\n}\nYou can see here the three nested environment forms, starting with the environment property of the top stack frame, reported in the pause:\n\nThe first environment form shows the environment record created by the call to g, with the string \"argument to g\" passed as the value of y.\nBecause g is nested within f, each function object generated for g captures the environment of a call to the enclosing function f.  Thus, the next thing on g's scope chain is an environment form for the call to f, where \"argument to f\" was passed as the vale of x.\nBecause f is a top-level function, the (only) function object for f closes over the global object. This is the \"type\":\"object\" environment shown as the parent of f's environment record.\nBecause the global object is at the end of the scope chain, its environment form has no parent property.\n\nBreakpoints\nWhile a thread is paused, a client can set breakpoints in the thread's code by sending requests of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"setBreakpoint\", \"location\": }\nwhere location is a source location. If the thread is able to establish a breakpoint at the given location, it replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"actor\":, \"actualLocation\": }\nwhere actor is an actor representing the breakpoint (a child of the thread actor), and actualLocation is the location at which the breakpoint was really set. If location and actualLocation are the same, then the actualLocation property can be omitted.\nIf the thread cannot find the script referred to in location, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"noScript\" }\nIf location refers to a line and column at which the given script has no program code, and no reasonable alternative location can be chosen (say, by skipping forward), then the thread sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"noCodeAtLineColumn\" }\nTo delete a breakpoint, the client can send the breakpoint's actor a message of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"delete\" }\nto which the breakpoint actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nThis closes communications with breakpointActor.\nEvent Listeners\nTo request a list of all the event listeners and event handlers (see DOM Event Handlers for definitions of the two terms) attached to the page, the client sends a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"eventListeners\" }\nThe thread replies with a response of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"listeners\":[ , ... ] }\nSuch requests can be sent when the thread is either paused or running. A listener value has the form:\n{ \"node\":{ \"selector\":, \"object\": },\n  \"type\":,\n  \"capturing\":,\n  \"allowsUntrusted\":,\n  \"inSystemEventGroup\":,\n  \"isEventHandler\":,\n  \"function\": }\nThe values for these properties are:\nnode-selector\nA unique CSS selector of the DOM element on which the event handler is attached, or \"window\" if the handler is attached on the window.\nnode\nA grip on the DOM element on which the event handler is attached.\ntype\nThe type of the DOM event as specified in the DOM specification (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\ncapturing\nA boolean flag indicating whether the event listener is in capture mode (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\nallowsUntrusted\nA boolean flag that indicates whether the listener allows untrusted events (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\ninSystemEventGroup\nA boolean flag that indicates whether or not the event listener is in the system event group (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\nisEventHandler\nA boolean flag indicating whether this is an event handler or an event listener (see DOM Event Handlers for definitions of the two terms). For HTML attribute handlers or assignments to WebIDL properties this flag would be true.\nfunction\nA grip on the function object.\nStream Transport\nThe debugging protocol is specified in terms of packets exchanged between a client and server, where each packet is either a JSON text or a block of bytes (a \"bulk data\" packet). The protocol does not specify any particular mechanism for carrying packets from one party to the other. Implementations may choose whatever transport they like, as long as packets arrive reliably, undamaged, and in order.\nThis section describes the Mozilla Remote Debugging Protocol Stream Transport, a transport layer suitable for carrying Mozilla debugging protocol packets over a reliable, ordered byte stream, like a TCP/IP stream or a pipe. Debugger user interfaces can use it to exchange packets with debuggees in other processes (say, for debugging Firefox chrome code), or on other machines (say, for debugging Firefox OS apps running on a phone or tablet).\n(The Stream Transport is not the only transport used by Mozilla. For example, when using Firefox's built-in script debugger, the client and server are in the same process, so for efficiency they use a transport that simply exchanges the JavaScript objects corresponding to the JSON texts specified by the protocol, and avoid serializing packets altogether.)\nPackets\nOnce the underlying byte stream is established, transport participants may immediately begin sending packets, using the forms described here. The transport requires no initial handshake or setup, and no shutdown exchange: the first bytes on the stream in each direction are those of the first packet, if any; the last bytes on the stream in each direction are the final bytes of the last packet sent, if any.\nThe transport defines two types of packets: JSON and bulk data.\nJSON Packets\nA JSON packet has the form:\nlength:JSON\nwhere length is a series of decimal ASCII digits, JSON is a well-formed JSON text (as defined in RFC 4627) encoded in UTF-8, and length, interpreted as a number, is the length of JSON in bytes.\nBulk Data Packets\nA bulk data packet has the form:\nbulk actor type length:data\nwhere:\n\nThe keyword bulk is encoded in ASCII, and the spaces are always exactly one ASCII space\nactor is a sequence of Unicode characters, encoded in UTF-8, containing no spaces or colons\ntype is a sequence of Unicode characters, encoded in UTF-8, containing no spaces or colons\nlength is a sequence of decimal ASCII digits\ndata is a sequence of bytes whose length is length interpreted as a number\n\nThe actor field is the name of the actor sending or receiving the packet. (Actors are server-side entities, so if the packet was sent by the client, actor names the recipient; and if the packet was sent by the server, actor names the sender.) The protocol imposes the same syntactic restrictions on actor names that we require here.\nWhich actor names are valid at any given point in an exchange is established by the remote debugging protocol.\nThe type field defines the type of the packet, which may be used with the actor name to route the packet to its destination properly. The protocol provides more detail about the type, which remains in effect here.\nThe content of a bulk data packet is exactly the sequence of bytes appearing as data. Data is not UTF-8 text.\nStream Requirements\nThe Stream Transport requires the underlying stream to have the following properties:\n\nIt must be transparent: each transmitted byte is carried to the recipient without modification. Bytes whose values are ASCII control characters or fall outside the range of ASCII altogether must be carried unchanged; line terminators are left alone.\nIt must be reliable: every transmitted byte makes it to the recipient, or else the connection is dropped altogether. Errors introduced by hardware, say, must be detected and corrected, or at least reported (and the connection dropped). The Stream Transport includes no checksums of its own; those are the stream's responsibility. (So, for example, a plain serial line is not suitable for use as an underlying stream.)\nIt must be ordered: bytes are received in the same order they are transmitted, and bytes are not duplicated. (UDP packets, for example, may be duplicated or arrive out of order.)\n\nTCP/IP streams and USB streams meet these requirements.\nImplementation Notes\nConstant-Overhead Bulk Data\nMozilla added bulk data packets to the protocol to let devices with limited memory upload performance profiling and other large data sets more efficiently. Profiling data sets need to be as large as possible, as larger data sets can cover a longer period of time or more frequent samples. However, converting a large data set to a JavaScript object, converting that object to a JSON text, and sending the text over the connection entails making several temporary complete copies of the data; on small devices, this limits how much data the profiler can collect. Avoiding these temporary copies would allow small devices to collect and transmit larger profile data sets. Since it seemed likely that other sorts of tools would need to exchange large binary blocks efficiently as well, we wanted a solution usable by all protocol participants, rather than one tailored to the profiler's specific case.\nIn our implementation of this Stream Transport, when a participant wishes to transmit a bulk data packet, it provides the actor name, the type, the data's length in bytes, and a callback function. When the underlying stream is ready to send more data, the transport writes the packet's bulk actor type length: header, and then passes the underlying nsIOutputStream to the callback, which then writes the packet's data portion directly to the stream. Similarly, when a participant receives a bulk data packet, the transport parses the header, and then passes the actor name, type, and the transport's underlying nsIInputStream to a callback function, which consumes the data directly. Thus, while the callback functions may well use fixed-size buffers to send and receive data, the transport imposes no overhead proportional to the full size of the data.\n"},"backend/client-api.html":{"url":"backend/client-api.html","title":"Client API","keywords":"","body":"Client API\nDevTools has a client module that allows applications to be written that debug or inspect web pages using the Remote Debugging Protocol.\nStarting communication\nIn order to communicate, a client and a server instance must be created and a protocol connection must be established. The connection can be either over a TCP socket or an nsIPipe. The start function displayed below establishes an nsIPipe-backed connection:\nconst { DevToolsServer } = require(\"devtools/server/devtools-server\");\nconst { DevToolsClient } = require(\"devtools/client/devtools-client\");\n\nfunction start() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DevToolsServer.init();\n  DevToolsServer.registerAllActors();\n\n  // Listen to an nsIPipe\n  let transport = DevToolsServer.connectPipe();\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DevToolsClient(transport);\n\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is connected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nIf a TCP socket is required, the function should be split in two parts, a server-side and a client-side, like this:\nconst { DevToolsServer } = require(\"devtools/server/devtools-server\");\nconst { DevToolsClient } = require(\"devtools/client/devtools-client\");\n\nfunction startServer() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DevToolsServer.init();\n  DevToolsServer.registerAllActors();\n\n  // For an nsIServerSocket we do this:\n  DevToolsServer.openListener(2929); // A connection on port 2929.\n}\n\nasync function startClient() {\n  let transport = await DevToolsClient.socketConnect({ host: \"localhost\", port: 2929 });\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DevToolsClient(transport);\n\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is connected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nShutting down\nWhen the application is finished, it has to notify the client to shut down the protocol connection. This makes sure that memory leaks are avoided and the server is terminated in an orderly fashion. Shutting down is as simple as it gets:\nfunction shutdown() {\n  client.close();\n}\n\nAttaching to a browser tab\nAttaching to a browser tab requires enumerating the available tabs and attaching to one:\nfunction attachToTab() {\n  // Get the list of tabs to find the one to attach to.\n  client.mainRoot.listTabs().then(tabs => {\n    // Find the active tab.\n    let targetFront = tabs.find(tab => tab.selected);\n\n    // Attach to the tab.\n    targetFront.attach().then(() => {\n      // Now the targetFront is ready and can be used.\n\n      // Attach listeners for client events.\n      targetFront.on(\"tabNavigated\", onTab);\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nThe devtools client will send event notifications for a number of events the application may be interested in. These events include state changes in the debugger, like pausing and resuming, stack frames or source scripts being ready for retrieval, etc.\nHandling location changes\nWhen the user navigates away from a page, a tabNavigated event will be fired. The proper way to handle this event is to detach from the previous thread and tab and attach to the new ones:\nasync function onTab() {\n  // Detach from the previous tab.\n  await targetFront.detach();\n  // Start debugging the new tab.\n  start();\n}\n\nDebugging JavaScript running in a browser tab\nOnce the application is attached to a tab, it can attach to its thread in order to interact with the JavaScript debugger:\n// Assuming the application is already attached to the tab, and response is the first\n// argument of the attachTarget callback.\n\nclient.attachThread(response.threadActor).then(function(threadFront) {\n  if (!threadFront) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Attach listeners for thread events.\n  threadFront.on(\"paused\", onPause);\n  threadFront.on(\"resumed\", fooListener);\n\n  // Resume the thread.\n  threadFront.resume();\n\n  // Debugger is now ready and debuggee is running.\n});\n\nDebugger application example\nHere is the source code for a complete debugger application:\n/*\n * Debugger API demo.\n */\nconst { DevToolsServer } = require(\"devtools/server/devtools-server\");\nconst { DevToolsClient } = require(\"devtools/client/devtools-client\");\n\nlet client;\nlet threadFront;\n\nfunction startDebugger() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DevToolsServer.init();\n  DevToolsServer.registerAllActors();\n  // Listen to an nsIPipe\n  let transport = DevToolsServer.connectPipe();\n  // For an nsIServerSocket we do this:\n  // DevToolsServer.openListener(port);\n  // ...and this at the client:\n  // let transport = debuggerSocketConnect(host, port);\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DevToolsClient(transport);\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is connected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nfunction shutdownDebugger() {\n  client.close();\n}\n\n/**\n * Start debugging the current tab.\n */\nfunction debugTab() {\n  // Get the list of tabs to find the one to attach to.\n  client.mainRoot.listTabs().then(tabs => {\n    // Find the active tab.\n    let targetFront = tabs.find(tab => tab.selected);\n    // Attach to the tab.\n    targetFront.attach().then(() => {\n      // Attach to the thread (context).\n      targetFront.attachThread().then((threadFront) => {\n        // Attach listeners for thread events.\n        threadFront.on(\"paused\", onPause);\n        threadFront.on(\"resumed\", fooListener);\n\n        // Resume the thread.\n        threadFront.resume();\n        // Debugger is now ready and debuggee is running.\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Handler for location changes.\n */\nfunction onTab() {\n  // Detach from the previous tab.\n  client.detach().then(() => {\n    // Start debugging the new tab.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Helper function to inspect the provided frame.\n */\nfunction inspectFrame(frame) {\n  // Get the \"this\" object.\n  if (frame[\"this\"]) {\n    getObjectProperties(frame[\"this\"]);\n  }\n\n  // Add \"arguments\".\n  if (frame.arguments && frame.arguments.length > 0) {\n    // frame.arguments is a regular Array.\n    dump(\"frame.arguments: \" + frame.arguments.toSource() + \"\\n\");\n\n    // Add variables for every argument.\n    let objClient = client.activeThread.pauseGrip(frame.callee);\n    objClient.getSignature(response => {\n      for (let i = 0; i  {\n    // Get prototype as a protocol-specified grip.\n    if (response.prototype.type != \"null\") {\n      dump(\"__proto__: \" + response.prototype.toSource() + \"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // Get the rest of the object's own properties as protocol-specified grips.\n    for (let prop of Object.keys(response.ownProperties)) {\n      dump(prop + \": \" + response.ownProperties[prop].toSource() + \"\\n\");\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Generic event listener.\n */\nfunction fooListener(event) {\n  dump(event + \"\\n\");\n}\n\n// Run the program.\nstartDebugger();\n\n// Execute the following line to stop the program.\n//shutdownDebugger();\n\n"},"backend/debugger-api.html":{"url":"backend/debugger-api.html","title":"Debugger API","keywords":"","body":"Debugger API\nThe Debugger API is a low-level API that provides methods for introspecting and affecting a target environment like a page.

At times, this can be difficult to achieve, however.\nSpecific Guidelines\nThe important compatibility scenarios are:\n\nNightly desktop client MUST maintain existing compatibility back to release channel servers.\n\nThis is mainly to simplify cross-platform use cases, i.e. desktop Nightly with release Fennec.\n\nServers MAY use traits to state a feature is not supported yet.\n\nThis helps us support alternate environments, which does not implement every possible server feature.\nCertainly when a new feature needs a new actor method to function, it won't work with servers that don't support it. But we should still ensure the client doesn't explode when using unrelated, existing features, at least until the above time windows have elapsed.\nTesting\nThe harder part of this currently is that there is no automated testing to ensure the above guidelines have been met. While we hope to have this at some point, for now manual testing is needed here.\nThe easiest way to test this is to check your work against a Firefox for Android device on release channel to ensure existing features in the area you are changing continue to function. That doesn't cover every case, but it's a great start.\nFeature Detection\nStarting with Firefox 36 (thanks to bug 1069673), you can use actor feature detection to determine which actors exist and what methods they expose.\n\nDetecting if the server has an actor: all you need is access to the Toolbox instance, which all panels do, when they get instantiated. Then you can do:\n\nlet hasPerformanceActor = toolbox.target.hasActor(\"performance\");\n\nThe hasActor method returns a boolean synchronously.\n\nDetecting if an actor has a given method: same thing here, you need access to the toolbox:\n\ntoolbox.target.actorHasMethod(\"domwalker\", \"duplicateNode\").then(hasMethod => {\n\n}).catch(console.error);\n\nThe actorHasMethod returns a promise that resolves to a boolean.\nRemoving old backward compatibility code\nWe used to support old Firefox OS servers (back to Gecko 28), we don't anymore. Does this mean we can remove compatibility traits for it?\nMaybe. Keep in mind that we still want to support Firefox for Android back to release channel, so we still want to keep traits in general. That's a much smaller time window than we supported for Firefox OS, so it should allow for some simplification.\nThe type of compatibility that could now be removed are things where the protocol semantics changed in some Gecko older than release channel and the trait is not useful for saying \"I don't support feature X\".\n"},"backend/actor-hierarchy.html":{"url":"backend/actor-hierarchy.html","title":"Actors Organization","keywords":"","body":"How actors are organized\nTo start with, actors are living within devtools/server/actors folder.\nThey are organized in a hierarchy for easier lifecycle and memory management:\nonce a parent is removed from the pool, its children are removed as well.\n(See actor-registration.md for more information about how to implement one)\nThe overall hierarchy of actors looks like this:\nRootActor: First one, automatically instantiated when we start connecting.\n   |       Mostly meant to instantiate new actors.\n   |\n   |-- Global-scoped actors:\n   |   Actors exposing features related to the main process, that are not\n   |   specific to any particular target (document, tab, add-on, or worker).\n   |   These actors are registered with `global: true` in\n   |   devtools/server/main.js.\n   |   Examples include:\n   |   PreferenceActor (for Firefox prefs)\n   |\n   \\-- Target actors:\n       Actors that represent the main \"thing\" being targeted by a given toolbox,\n       such as a tab, frame, worker, add-on, etc. and track its lifetime.\n       Generally, there is a target actor for each thing you can point a\n       toolbox at.\n       Examples include:\n       FrameTargetActor (for a frame, such as a tab)\n       WorkerTargetActor (for various kind of workers)\n       |\n       \\-- Target-scoped actors:\n           Actors exposing one particular feature set.

It also allows to\nfetch the target-scoped actors connected to this target, which are actors like\nconsole, inspector, thread (for debugger), style inspector, etc.\nSome target actors inherit from BrowsingContextTargetActor (defined in\nbrowsing-context.js) which is meant for \"browsing contexts\" which present\ndocuments to the user. It automatically tracks the lifetime of the targeted\nbrowsing context, but it also tracks its iframes and allows switching the\ntarget to one of its iframes.\nFor historical reasons, target actors also handle creating the ThreadActor, used\nto manage breakpoints in the debugger. Actors inheriting from\nBrowsingContextTargetActor expose attach/detach requests, that allows to\nstart/stop the ThreadActor.\nTarget-scoped actors are accessed via the target actor's RDP form which contains\nthe actorID for each target-scoped actor.\nThe target-scoped actors expect to find the following properties on the target\nactor:\n\nthreadActor:\nThreadActor instance for the given target,\nonly defined once attach request is called, or on construction.\nisRootActor: (historical name)\nAlways false, except on ParentProcessTargetActor.\nDespite the attribute name, it is being used to accept all resources\n(like chrome one) instead of limiting only to content resources.\nmakeDebugger:\nHelper function used to create Debugger object for the target.\n(See actors/utils/make-debugger.js for more info)\n\nIn addition to this, the actors inheriting from BrowsingContextTargetActor,\nexpose many other attributes and events:\n\nwindow:\nReference to the window global object currently targeted.\nIt can change over time if we switch target to an iframe, so it\nshouldn't be stored in a variable, but always retrieved from the actor.\nwindows:\nList of all document globals including the main window object and all\niframes.\ndocShell:\nPrimary docShell reference for the targeted document.\ndocShells:\nList of all docShells for the targeted document and all its iframes.\nchromeEventHandler:\nThe chrome event handler for the current target. Allows to listen to events\nthat can be missing/cancelled on this document itself.\n\nSee BrowsingContextTargetActor documentation for more details.\nTarget-scoped actors\nEach of these actors focuses on providing one particular feature set. They are\nchildren of a given target actor.\nThe data they return is filtered to reflect the target. For example, the\nInspectorActor that you fetch from a FrameTargetActor gives you information\nabout the markup and styles for only that frame.\nThese actors may extend this hierarchy by having their own children, like\nLongStringActor, WalkerActor, etc.\nTo improve performance, target-scoped actors are created lazily. The target\nactor lists the actor ID for each one, but the actor modules aren't actually\nloaded and instantiated at that point. Once the first request for a given\ntarget-scoped actor is received by the server, that specific actor is\ninstantiated just in time to service the request.\n"},"backend/actor-e10s-handling.html":{"url":"backend/actor-e10s-handling.html","title":"Handling Multi-Processes in Actors","keywords":"","body":"How to handle E10S in actors\nIn multi-process environments, most devtools actors are created and initialized in the child content process, to be able to access the resources they are exposing to the toolbox. But sometimes, these actors need to access things in the parent process too. Here's why and how.\nThis documentation page is deprecated. setupInParent relies on the message manager which is being deprecated. Furthermore, communications between parent and content processes should be avoided for security reasons. If possible, the client should be responsible for calling actors both on the parent and content process.\nThis page will be removed when all actors relying on this API are removed.\n\nUse case and examples\nSome actors need to exchange messages between the parent and the child process (typically when some components aren't available in the child process).\nTo that end, there's a parent/child setup mechanism at DevToolsServer level that can be used.\nWhen the actor is loaded for the first time in the DevToolsServer running in the child process, it may decide to run a setup procedure to load a module in the parent process with which to communicate.\nExample code for the actor running in the child process:\n  const {DevToolsServer} = require(\"devtools/server/devtools-server\");\n\n  // Setup the childparent communication only if the actor module\n  // is running in a child process.\n  if (DevToolsServer.isInChildProcess) {\n    setupChildProcess();\n  }\n\n  function setupChildProcess() {\n    // `setupInParent`  is defined on DevToolsServerConnection,\n    // your actor receives a reference to one instance in its constructor.\n    conn.setupInParent({\n      module: \"devtools/server/actors/module-name\",\n      setupParent: \"setupParentProcess\"\n    });\n    // ...\n  }\nThe setupChildProcess helper defined and used in the previous example uses the DevToolsServerConnection.setupInParent to run a given setup function in the parent process DevTools Server.\nWith this, the DevToolsServer running in the parent process will require the requested module and call its setupParentProcess function (which should be exported on the module).\nThe setupParentProcess function will receive a parameter that contains a reference to the MessageManager and a prefix that should be used to send/receive messages between the child and parent processes.\nSee below an example implementation of a setupParent function in the parent process:\nexports.setupParentProcess = function setupParentProcess({ mm, prefix }) {\n  // Start listening for messages from the actor in the child process.\n  setMessageManager(mm);\n\n  function handleChildRequest(msg) {\n    switch (msg.json.method) {\n      case \"get\":\n        return doGetInParentProcess(msg.json.args[0]);\n        break;\n      case \"list\":\n        return doListInParentProcess();\n        break;\n      default:\n        console.error(\"Unknown method name\", msg.json.method);\n        throw new Error(\"Unknown method name\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  function setMessageManager(newMM) {\n    if (mm) {\n      // Remove listener from old message manager\n      mm.removeMessageListener(\"debug:some-message-name\", handleChildRequest);\n    }\n    // Switch to the new message manager for future use\n    // Note: Make sure that any other functions also use the new reference.\n    mm = newMM;\n    if (mm) {\n      // Add listener to new message manager\n      mm.addMessageListener(\"debug:some-message-name\", handleChildRequest);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    onDisconnected: () => setMessageManager(null),\n  };\n};\nThe server will call the onDisconnected method returned by the parent process setup flow to give the actor modules the chance to cleanup their handlers registered on the disconnected message manager.\nSummary of the setup flow\nIn the child process:\n\nThe DevToolsServer loads an actor module,\nthe actor module checks DevToolsServer.isInChildProcess to know whether it runs in a child process or not,\nthe actor module then uses the DevToolsServerConnection.setupInParent helper to start setting up a parent-process counterpart,\nthe DevToolsServerConnection.setupInParent helper asks the parent process to run the required module's setup function,\nthe actor module uses the DevToolsServerConnection.parentMessageManager.sendSyncMessage and DevToolsServerConnection.parentMessageManager.addMessageListener helpers to send or listen to message.\n\nIn the parent process:\n\nThe DevToolsServer receives the DevToolsServerConnection.setupInParent request,\ntries to load the required module,\ntries to call the module[setupParent] function with the frame message manager and the prefix as parameters { mm, prefix },\nthe setupParent function then uses the mm to subscribe the message manager events,\nthe setupParent function returns an object with a onDisconnected method which the server can use to notify the module of various lifecycle events\n\n"},"backend/protocol.js.html":{"url":"backend/protocol.js.html","title":"Writing Actors With protocol.js","keywords":"","body":"Writing an Actor\nA Simple Hello World\nHere's a simple Hello World actor.  It is a global actor (not associated with a given browser tab).\nIt has two parts: a spec and an implementation.

The return value of the function\n      // will be plugged in where the RetVal() appears in the template.\n      response: {\n        greeting: RetVal(\"string\") // \"string\" is the return value type.\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n// Expose the spec so it can be imported by the implementation.\nexports.helloWorldSpec = helloWorldSpec;\nThe actor implementation would go somewhere like\ndevtools/server/actors/hello-world.js and would look like:\nconst protocol = require(\"devtools/shared/protocol\");\nconst {helloWorldSpec} = require(\"devtools/shared/specs/hello-world\");\n\nconst HelloActor = protocol.ActorClassWithSpec(helloWorldSpec, {\n  initialize: function (conn) {\n    protocol.Actor.prototype.initialize.call(this, conn); // This is the worst part of heritage.\n  },\n\n  sayHello: function () {\n   return \"hello\";\n  },\n});\n\n// You also need to export the actor class in your module for discovery.\nexports.HelloActor = HelloActor;\nTo activate your actor, register it in the addBrowserActors method in server/actors/utils/actor-registry.js.\nThe registration code would look something like this:\nthis.registerModule(\"devtools/server/actors/hello-world\", {\n  prefix: \"hello\",\n  constructor: \"HelloActor\",\n  type: { global: true }\n});\nYour spec allows the actor to support a sayHello request.\nA request/reply will look like this:\n-> { to: , type: \"sayHello\" }\n, greeting: \"hello\" }\nNow we can create a client side object.  We call these front objects and\nthey typically go in devtools/client/fronts/.\nHere's the front for the HelloActor:\nconst HelloFront = protocol.FrontClassWithSpec(helloWorldSpec, {\n  initialize: function (client, form) {\n    protocol.Front.prototype.initialize.call(this, client, form);\n    // This call may not be required but it's a good idea. It will\n    // guarantee that your instance is managed in the pool.\n    this.manage(this);\n  }\n});\nNote that there is no sayHello method.  The FrontClass will generate a method on the Front object that matches the method declaration in the Actor class.\nThe generated methods will return a Promise.  That promise will resolve to the RetVal of the actor method.\nSo if we have a reference to a HelloFront object, we can issue a sayHello request:\nhello.sayHello().then(greeting => {\n  console.log(greeting);\n});\nHow do you get an initial reference to the front?  That's a bit tricky, but basically there are two ways:\n\nManually\nMagically\n\nManually - If you're using a DevToolsClient instance, you can discover the actorID manually and create a Front for it:\nlet hello = new HelloFront(this.client, { actor:  });\nMagically - Once you have an initial reference to a protocol.js object, it can return other protocol.js objects and fronts will automatically be created.\nArguments\nsayHello has no arguments, so let's add a method that does take arguments.\nHere's an adjustment to the spec:\nmethods: {\n  echo: {\n    request: { echo: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    response: { echoed: RetVal(\"string\") }\n  }\n}\nHere's an adjustment to the implementation:\necho: function (str) {\n  return str + \"... \" + str + \"...\";\n}\nThis tells the library to place the 0th argument, which should be a string, in the echo property of the request packet.\nThis will generate a request handler whose request and response packets look like this:\n{ to: , type: \"echo\", echo:  }\n{ from: , echoed:  }\nThe client usage should be predictable:\nhello.echo(\"hello\").then(str => { assert(str === \"hello... hello...\") })\nThe library tries hard to make using fronts feel like natural javascript (or as natural as you believe promises are, I guess).  When building the response it will put the return value of the function where RetVal() is specified in the response template, and on the client side it will use the value in that position when resolving the promise.\nReturning JSON\nMaybe your response is an object. Here's an example of a spec:\nmethods: {\n  addOneTwice: {\n    request: { a: Arg(0, \"number\"), b: Arg(1, \"number\") },\n    response: { ret: RetVal(\"json\") }\n  }\n}\nHere's an example implementation:\naddOneTwice: function (a, b) {\n  return { a: a + 1, b: b + 1 };\n}\nThis will generate a response packet that looks like:\n{ from: , ret: { a: , b:  } }\nThat's probably unnecessary nesting (if you're sure you won't be returning an object with 'from' as a key!), so you can just replace response with:\nresponse: RetVal(\"json\")\nand now your packet will look like:\n{ from: , a: , b:  }\nTypes and Marshalling\nThings have been pretty simple up to this point - all the arguments we've passed in have been javascript primitives.  But for some types (most importantly Actor types, which I'll get to eventually), we can't just copy them into a JSON packet and expect it to work, we need to marshal things ourselves.\nAgain, the protocol lib tries hard to provide a natural API to actors and clients, and sometime that natural API might involve object APIs. I'm going to use a wickedly contrived example, bear with me.  Let's say I have a small object that contains a number and has a few methods associated with it:\nlet Incrementor = function (i) {\n  this.value = value;\n}\nIncrementor.prototype = {\n    increment: function () { this.value++ },\n    decrement: function () { this.value-- }\n};\nand I want to return it from a backend function:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getIncrementor: {\n    request: { number: Arg(0, \"number\") },\n    response: { value: RetVal(\"incrementor\") } // We'll define \"incrementor\" below.\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetIncrementor: function (i) {\n  return new Incrementor(i)\n}\nI want that response to look like { from: , value:  }, but the client side needs to know to return an Incrementor, not a primitive number.  So let's tell the protocol lib about Incrementors:\nprotocol.types.addType(\"incrementor\", {\n    // When writing to a protocol packet, just send the value\n    write: (v) => v.value,\n\n    // When reading from a protocol packet, wrap with an Incrementor\n    // object.\n    read: (v) => new Incrementor(v)\n});\nAnd now our client can use the API as expected:\nfront.getIncrementor(5).then(incrementor => {\n    incrementor.increment();\n    assert(incrementor.value === 6);\n});\nYou can do the same thing with arguments:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  passIncrementor: {\n    request: { Arg(0, \"incrementor\") },\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\npassIncrementor: function (inc) {\n  w.increment();\n  assert(incrementor.value === 6);\n}\n\nfront.passIncrementor(new Incrementor(5));\nThe library provides primitiive boolean, number, string, and json types.\nMoving right along, let's say you want to pass/return an array of Incrementors.  You can just prepend array: to the type name:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  incrementAll: {\n    request: { incrementors: Arg(0, \"array:incrementor\") },\n    response: { incrementors: RetVal(\"array:incrementor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\nincrementAll: function (incrementors) {\n  incrementors.forEach(incrementor => {\n    incrementor.increment();\n  }\n  return incrementors;\n}\nYou can use an iterator in place of an array as an argument or return value, and the library will handle the conversion automatically.\nOr maybe you want to return a dictionary where one item is a incrementor.  To do this you need to tell the type system which members of the dictionary need custom marshallers:\nprotocol.types.addDictType(\"contrivedObject\", {\n  incrementor: \"incrementor\",\n  incrementorArray: \"array:incrementor\"\n});\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  reallyContrivedExample: {\n    response: RetVal(\"contrivedObject\")\n  }\n}\n\n// implementations:\nreallyContrivedExample: function () {\n  return {\n    /* a and b are primitives and so don't need to be called out specifically in addDictType */\n    a: \"hello\", b: \"world\",\n    incrementor: new Incrementor(1),\n    incrementorArray: [new Incrementor(2), new Incrementor(3)]\n  }\n}\n\nfront.reallyContrivedExample().then(obj => {\n  assert(obj.a == \"hello\");\n  assert(obj.b == \"world\");\n  assert(incrementor.i == 1);\n  assert(incrementorArray[0].i == 2);\n  assert(incrementorArray[1].i == 3);\n});\nNullables\nIf an argument, return value, or dict property can be null/undefined, you can prepend nullable: to the type name:\n\"nullable:incrementor\",  // Can be null/undefined or an incrementor\n\"array:nullable:incrementor\", // An array of incrementors that can have holes.\n\"nullable:array:incrementor\" // Either null/undefined or an array of incrementors without holes.\nActors\nProbably the most common objects that need custom martialing are actors themselves.  These are more interesting than the Incrementor object, but by default they're somewhat easy to work with.  Let's add a ChildActor implementation that will be returned by the HelloActor (which is rapidly becoming the OverwhelminglyComplexActor):\n// spec:\nconst childActorSpec = generateActorSpec({\n  actorType: \"childActor\",\n  methods: {\n    getGreeting: {\n      response: { greeting: RetVal(\"string\") },\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// implementation:\nconst ChildActor = protocol.ActorClassWithSpec(childActorSpec, {\n  initialize: function (conn, id) {\n    protocol.Actor.prototype.initialize.call(this, conn);\n    this.greeting = \"hello from \" + id;\n  },\n  getGreeting: function () {\n    return this.greeting;\n  },\n});\n\nexports.ChildActor = ChildActor;\n\nconst ChildFront = protocol.FrontClassWithSpec(childActorSpec, {\n  initialize: function (client, form) {\n    protocol.Front.prototype.initialize.call(this, client, form);\n  },\n});\nThe library will register a marshaller for the actor type itself, using typeName as its tag.\nSo we can now add the following code to HelloActor:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetChild: function (id) {\n  return ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\n\nfront.getChild(\"child1\").then(childFront => {\n  return childFront.getGreeting();\n}).then(greeting => {\n  assert(id === \"hello from child1\");\n});\nThe conversation will look like this:\n{ to: , type: \"getChild\", id: \"child1\" }\n{ from: , child: { actor:  }}\n{ to: , type: \"getGreeting\" }\n{ from: , greeting: \"hello from child1\" }\nBut the ID is the only interesting part of this made-up example.  You're never going to want a reference to a ChildActor without checking its ID.  Making an extra request just to get that id is wasteful.  You really want the first response to look like { from: , child: { actor: , greeting: \"hello from child1\" } }\nYou can customize the marshalling of an actor by providing a form method in the ChildActor class:\nform: function () {\n    return {\n        actor: this.actorID,\n        greeting: this.greeting\n    }\n},\nAnd you can demarshal in the ChildFront class by implementing a matching form method:\nform: function (form) {\n    this.actorID = form.actor;\n    this.greeting = form.greeting;\n}\nNow you can use the id immediately:\nfront.getChild(\"child1\").then(child => { assert(child.greeting === \"child1) });\nYou may come across a situation where you want to customize the output of a form method depending on the operation being performed.  For example, imagine that ChildActor is a bit more complex, with a, b, c, and d members:\nChildActor:\n    form: function () {\n        return {\n            actor: this.actorID,\n            greeting: this.greeting,\n            a: this.a,\n            b: this.b,\n            c: this.c,\n            d: this.d\n        }\n    }\nChildFront:\n    form: function (form) {\n        this.actorID = form.actorID;\n        this.id = form.id;\n        this.a = form.a;\n        this.b = form.b;\n        this.c = form.c;\n        this.d = form.d;\n    }\nAnd imagine you want to change 'c' and return the object:\n// Oops!  If a type is going to return references to itself or any other\n// type that isn't fully registered yet, you need to predeclare the type.\ntypes.addActorType(\"childActor\");\n\n...\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  changeC: {\n    request: { newC: Arg(0) },\n    response: { self: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\nchangeC: function (newC) {\n  c = newC;\n  return this;\n}\n\n...\n\nchildFront.changeC('hello').then(ret => { assert(ret === childFront); assert(childFront.c === \"hello\") });\nNow our response will look like:\n{ from: , self: { actor: , greeting: , a: , b: , c: \"hello\", d:  }\nLifetimes\nNo, I don't want to talk about lifetimes quite yet.\nEvents\nYour actor has great news!\nActors are subclasses of jetpack EventTarget, so you can just emit events.\nHere's how you'd set it up in a spec:\nevents: {\n  \"good-news\": {\n    type: \"goodNews\", // event target naming and packet naming are at odds, and we want both to be natural!\n    news: Arg(0)\n  }\n}\n\nmethods: {\n  giveGoodNews: {\n    request: { news: Arg(0) }\n  }\n}\nHere's how the implementation would look:\nconst EventEmitter = require(\"devtools/shared/event-emitter\");\n\n// In your protocol.ActorClassWithSpec definition:\ngiveGoodNews: function (news) {\n  EventEmitter.emit(this, \"good-news\", news);\n}\nNow you can listen to events on a front:\nfront.on(\"good-news\", news => {\n  console.log(`Got some good news: ${news}\\n`);\n});\nfront.giveGoodNews().then(() => { console.log(\"request returned.\") });\nIf you want to modify the argument that will be passed to event listeners callbacks, you\ncan use before(eventName, fn) in the front definition. This can only be used once for a\ngiven eventName. The fn function will be called before emitting the event via\nthe EventEmitter API on the Front, and its return value will be passed to the event\nlistener callbacks. If fn is async, the event will only be emitted after fn call resolves.\n// In front file, most probably in the constructor:\nthis.before(\"good-news\", function(news) {\n  return news.join(\" - \");\n});\n\n// In any consumer\nfront.on(\"good-news\", function(news) {\n  console.log(news);\n});\nSo if the server sent the following array: [1, 2, 3], the console.log in the consumer\nwould print 1 - 2 - 3.\nOn a somewhat related note, not every method needs to be request/response.  Just like an actor can emit a one-way event, a method can be marked as a one-way request.  Maybe we don't care about giveGoodNews returning anything:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  giveGoodNews: {\n    request: { news: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    oneway: true\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngiveGoodNews: function (news) {\n  emit(this, \"good-news\", news);\n}\nLifetimes\nNo, let's talk about custom front methods instead.\nCustom Front Methods\nYou might have some bookkeeping to do before issuing a request.  Let's say you're calling echo, but you want to count the number of times you issue that request.  Just use the custom tag in your front implementation:\necho: custom(function (str) {\n    this.numEchos++;\n    return this._echo(str);\n}, {\n    impl: \"_echo\"\n})\nThis puts the generated implementation in _echo instead of echo, letting you implement echo as needed.  If you leave out the impl, it just won't generate the implementation at all.  You're on your own.\nLifetimes\nOK, I can't think of any more ways to put this off.  The remote debugging protocol has the concept of a parent for each actor.  This is to make distributed memory management a bit easier.  Basically, any descendents of an actor will be destroyed if the actor is destroyed.\nOther than that, the basic protocol makes no guarantees about lifetime.  Each interface defined in the protocol will need to discuss and document its approach to lifetime management (although there are a few common patterns).\nThe protocol library will maintain the child/parent relationships for you, but it needs some help deciding what the child/parent relationships are.\nThe default parent of an object is the first object that returns it after it is created.  So to revisit our earlier HelloActor getChild implementation:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetChild: function (id) {\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\nThe ChildActor's parent is the HelloActor, because it's the one that created it.\nYou can customize this behavior in two ways.  The first is by defining a marshallPool property in your actor.  Imagine a new ChildActor method:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getSibling: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetSibling: function (id) {\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\nThis creates a new child actor owned by the current child actor.  But in this example we want all actors created by the child to be owned by the HelloActor.  So we can define a defaultParent property that makes use of the parent property provided by the Actor class:\nget marshallPool() { return this.parent }\nThe front needs to provide a matching defaultParent property that returns an owning front, to make sure the client and server lifetimes stay synced.\nFor more complex situations, you can define your own lifetime properties.  Take this new pair of HelloActor methods:\n// When the \"temp\" lifetime is specified, look for the _temporaryParent attribute as the owner.\ntypes.addLifetime(\"temp\", \"_temporaryParent\");\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getTemporaryChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: {\n      child: RetVal(\"temp:childActor\") // use the lifetime name here to specify the expected lifetime.\n    }\n  },\n  clearTemporaryChildren: {\n    oneway: true\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetTemporaryChild: function (id) {\n  if (!this._temporaryParent) {\n    // Create an actor to serve as the parent for all temporary children and explicitly\n    // add it as a child of this actor.\n    this._temporaryParent = new Actor(this.conn));\n    this.manage(this._temporaryParent);\n  }\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\n\nclearTemporaryChildren: function () {\n  if (this._temporaryParent) {\n    this._temporaryParent.destroy();\n    delete this._temporaryParent;\n  }\n}\nThis will require some matching work on the front:\ngetTemporaryChild: protocol.custom(function (id) {\n    if (!this._temporaryParent) {\n        this._temporaryParent = this.manage(new Front(this.client));\n    }\n    return this._getTemporaryChild(id);\n}, {\n    impl: \"_getTemporaryChild\"\n}),\n\nclearTemporaryChildren: protocol.custom(function (id) {\n    if (this._temporaryParent) {\n        this._temporaryParent.destroy();\n        delete this._temporaryParent;\n    }\n    return this._clearTemporaryChildren();\n}, {\n    impl: \"_clearTemporaryChildren\"\n})\n"},"backend/actor-registration.html":{"url":"backend/actor-registration.html","title":"Registering A New Actor","keywords":"","body":"How to register an actor\nTarget-scoped actors vs. global actors\nTarget-scoped actors are the most common types of actors.

Here's an example from the animation actor:\ndestroy: function() {\n  Actor.prototype.destroy.call(this);\n  this.targetActor.off(\"will-navigate\", this.onWillNavigate);\n  this.targetActor.off(\"navigate\", this.onNavigate);\n\n  this.stopAnimationPlayerUpdates();\n  this.targetActor = this.observer = this.actors = null;\n},\n\nChild Actors\nWith protocol.js actors, if your creates child actors for further functionality, in most cases you should call:\nthis.manage(child);\n\nin the parent after constructing the child, so that the child is destroyed when the parent is.\n"},"preferences.html":{"url":"preferences.html","title":"Preferences","keywords":"","body":"Preferences\nThis documentation aims at giving an overview of the preferences API used in DevTools, it\nis not an actual documentation about the list of preferences available in DevTools.\nOverview\nPreferences allows you to save and read strings, numbers, booleans to the preferences\nstore, which is tied to a profile.
